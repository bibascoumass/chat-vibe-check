2007-08-22T09:18:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,thanks
2007-08-22T09:18:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,can a noob use this?
2007-08-22T09:19:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,sure.  do you know how to image the whole drive?
2007-08-22T09:19:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,not using Ubuntu
2007-08-22T09:20:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250, how big is the drive that got trashed?
2007-08-22T09:20:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,weee!!!   got 160gb free somewhere?
2007-08-22T09:20:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,yep
2007-08-22T09:21:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,will this recover from ext3 aswell?
2007-08-22T09:21:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,yay.  dd if=/dev/hda of=/path/to/lots/of/space/hda.img
2007-08-22T09:22:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,ouch
2007-08-22T09:22:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,what?
2007-08-22T09:22:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"hda.img will be a 160gig file, so make sure where ever you are storing that can hold it"
2007-08-22T09:22:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,the free space is a drive that I tryed to install ubuntu but it didn't work.
2007-08-22T09:23:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,yep
2007-08-22T09:23:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,got a 300 gb USB drive
2007-08-22T09:23:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"hope it is usb2, else it is gonna take days or weeks :)"
2007-08-22T09:23:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,yes
2007-08-22T09:24:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"there is something worth hours of time trying to save, right ?"
2007-08-22T09:24:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,how do I formate a drive so that I can use it for this purpose and then but the recovered files on to a NTFS drive.
2007-08-22T09:24:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,yes
2007-08-22T09:25:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"format as ext2 (mke2fs), then use http://www.fs-driver.org to read/write from win"
2007-08-22T09:26:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,OK i KNOW HOW TO USE fs
2007-08-22T09:27:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,but how do I formate the 300GB drive using ubuntu. I have limited use of this OS I was trying to learn and it had cause me many leters of tears
2007-08-22T09:27:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,on the 300gb hd is a botch attempt to install Ubuntu
2007-08-22T09:28:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,you need to figure out what 'device' it is. proably /dev/sda (use dmesg to verify that)  sudo mke2fs /dev/sda1
2007-08-22T09:28:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"mk..fs is Make FS, exactly what dos format does"
2007-08-22T09:29:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,what is this about ntfs ?
2007-08-22T09:30:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,NTFS is what is on another USB drive that I will want to move the recovered files to.
2007-08-22T09:31:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,I have no clue how well the ntfs write support is.  so I would write to ext2 and use the ext2 win driver to read from win and write to ntfs
2007-08-22T09:31:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,ok
2007-08-22T09:31:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,yes ext3
2007-08-22T09:32:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,so how do I do this recover?
2007-08-22T09:33:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250, no clue.  I seem to remember using it about a year to :)
2007-08-22T09:33:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,"oh crap, well I though I installed the program you gave me but I can't find it."
2007-08-22T09:34:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,it's find I can read ext3 using that program you suggested.  i HAVE done that before.
2007-08-22T09:34:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,fine
2007-08-22T09:35:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,how do I find the recover program?
2007-08-22T09:37:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,"yep I've used it, but I can't fine that damn recover program."
2007-08-22T09:37:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,it is in the universe repo - understand that ?
2007-08-22T09:38:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,where is that?
2007-08-22T09:38:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,nope I don't under stand sorry

2007-08-22T09:43:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,ok I think I did that
2007-08-22T09:44:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,were you talking about Downloadable from the internet?
2007-08-22T09:44:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250, hit 'reload' wait... hit 'search' and type 'reover'
2007-08-22T09:44:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,yes
2007-08-22T09:45:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,good.  now to figure out how to use it :)
2007-08-22T09:45:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,I'm going to upgrade recover
2007-08-22T09:46:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,ok upgraded
2007-08-22T09:46:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"find/install gpart 'Guess PC disk partition table, find lost partitions'"
2007-08-22T09:47:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,ok installed
2007-08-22T09:48:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,might as well get this too:  TestDisk Partition scanner and disk recovery tool
2007-08-22T09:49:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,ok onde
2007-08-22T09:49:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,done
2007-08-22T09:50:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,im booting up a 2nd box to experiment on... and gegting a drink.  just a sec
2007-08-22T09:50:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,ok I'm going to micowave my dinner

2007-08-22T09:57:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,ok
2007-08-22T09:59:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,"so I just want to lay things out for you again.  I have 3 USB HDs, and my laptop HD (witch won't be part of the recovery).  The usb drive that has the files on it that needs to be recovered is 160 GB, the second drive is 300GB ext3 with a messed up install of ubuntu, the 3rd USB drive is 500GB NTFS drive with my backups on it."
2007-08-22T10:00:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,oh and I'm currently using the ubuntu DVD.
2007-08-22T10:01:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,some how figure out the /dev/ of each usb drive.  lsusb and dmesg|less should be enough
2007-08-22T10:02:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK, only 2 of the drives are connected right now 160 and 300gb
2007-08-22T10:02:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,oh and I have no idea what you were asking me to do.
2007-08-22T10:03:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"heh.  actually, this should get the /dev/ info: fdisk -l"
2007-08-22T10:03:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,???
2007-08-22T10:03:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,what is /dev/
2007-08-22T10:04:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"man fdisk,  ' -l     List  the  partition  tables ...  '  will show you things like 'Disk /dev/sdc: 16 MB, 16384000 bytes'"
2007-08-22T10:04:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250, /dev/ is how linux gives you 'access' to devices.
2007-08-22T10:05:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,windows isn't working right nw.
2007-08-22T10:05:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"the drivers define the final name.  /dev/hda is Hard Disk A, /dev/sda1 is Scsi Disk A, partition 1"
2007-08-22T10:05:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,whats that got to do with anything ?
2007-08-22T10:06:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,fdisk
2007-08-22T10:06:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,fdisk was a unix command first :)
2007-08-22T10:06:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,??
2007-08-22T10:07:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,/dev/hda1 is 'close' to dos/window's C:

2007-08-22T10:12:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,what are the /dev/ for the 2 drives we care about ?
2007-08-22T10:14:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,/dev/sdb: 300gb  /dev/sdc: 160GB
2007-08-22T10:14:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,both just have 1 big partition ?
2007-08-22T10:15:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,no b has 3 and c has none.
2007-08-22T10:15:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,C is the messed up one
2007-08-22T10:15:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,and D is the one with the botched Ubuntu drive.
2007-08-22T10:15:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,where do you want to make the 160g backup file?

2007-08-22T10:17:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,where the botched ubuntu is.  Should I formate that drive first?
2007-08-22T10:17:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"which partition ?  sdb1, sdb2 or sdb3 ?"
2007-08-22T10:17:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"hang on, I need to take notes ... :)"
2007-08-22T10:18:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,can I copy the info on the termanal some how for you?

2007-08-22T10:22:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,nope
2007-08-22T10:24:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,make sure you understand what this next does.  double check my work (you know the man command?).  cuz this is a dozy: dd if=/dev/sdc of=/dev/sdb
2007-08-22T10:25:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,nope I don't know the man command.
2007-08-22T10:25:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,man dd
2007-08-22T10:25:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250, man = manual
2007-08-22T10:26:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,I have know idea what that does.
2007-08-22T10:26:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,man man = man - an interface to the on-line reference manuals ;)
2007-08-22T10:26:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250, documentation
2007-08-22T10:26:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,ok what do we need that for?
2007-08-22T10:27:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250, to make sure the dangerous commands are done right
2007-08-22T10:28:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,ok just tell me what to do and I'll try my best to fallow your instructions oh wise CarlFK.
2007-08-22T10:28:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"do this, all of it: make sure you understand what this next does.  double check my work (you know the man command?).  cuz this is a dozy: dd if=/dev/sdc of=/dev/sdb"
2007-08-22T10:30:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,so you want me to do dd if=/dev/sdc of=dev/sdb?
2007-08-22T10:30:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,is that one command?
2007-08-22T10:30:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,only if you can tell me what it does :)
2007-08-22T10:31:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,ah shit
2007-08-22T10:32:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,ok give me about 5 min to find the info.

2007-08-22T10:33:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"at the promt, type man man"
2007-08-22T10:33:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250, then man dd.  doubt you will find dd docs on ubuntu.com
2007-08-22T10:34:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,27?
2007-08-22T10:36:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,what about it?
2007-08-22T10:36:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,do you know what line the info is I'm looking for?
2007-08-22T10:37:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,no.  you need to read and understand.  ideally tell me what the command I gave you is gonna do
2007-08-22T10:37:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,yes master
2007-08-22T10:37:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,what was the command again?

2007-08-22T10:38:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,dd if=/dev/sdc of=/dev/sdb
2007-08-22T10:39:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,Ill throw you a bone: /dev/ things are/arn't files depending on who you ask.
2007-08-22T10:39:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"what is important is to understand what they do: they are a reference to a device, and can read/write to the devise just like you read/write to a file."
2007-08-22T10:40:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,I don't see DD
2007-08-22T10:40:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,did you type dd?

2007-08-22T10:43:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,so you're trying to teach me about man?
2007-08-22T10:43:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,yeah.  that should take you about 20 seconds.  (don't read the whole man man page)
2007-08-22T10:44:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,get on to man dd
2007-08-22T10:45:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,what does this mean?http://dpaste.com/17472/
2007-08-22T10:46:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,it means if you type 'man dd' you will get the manual page for dd :)
2007-08-22T10:48:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,dd - conver and copy a file
2007-08-22T10:48:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,ah that's it?
2007-08-22T10:48:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,getting close.
2007-08-22T10:51:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,copy from drive ...
2007-08-22T10:52:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,copy from this drive to another.
2007-08-22T10:53:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,yup.  did I get the drives right?
2007-08-22T10:53:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,i DON'T REMEMBER now.
2007-08-22T10:54:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,dd if=/dev/X of=/dev/Y  (you get figure out X and Y)
2007-08-22T10:55:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,x=c y=b
2007-08-22T10:55:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,but as you can see the c drive has no partision
2007-08-22T10:56:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,your going to help me recover it right?
2007-08-22T10:56:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,/dev/sdb is the whole drive.  /dev/sdb1 would be the first partition
2007-08-22T10:56:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,master
2007-08-22T10:56:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,yep
2007-08-22T10:56:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"yeah, and given the drives you have, we can make a backup, and then try to recover the backup"
2007-08-22T10:57:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,I don't under stand
2007-08-22T10:57:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,it's the c drive that we are trying to recover the files from.
2007-08-22T10:57:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,yet it has no partision
2007-08-22T10:57:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,dd if=/dev/sdc of=/dev/sdb = copy all of one drive to the other drive (including partition tables
2007-08-22T10:58:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,sounds good
2007-08-22T10:58:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,drives are just big wads of bytes.  don't need any partitions or files right now.  just gonna move all the bytes from input to output
2007-08-22T10:58:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,but I thought we had to make an img?
2007-08-22T10:59:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"I was, but changed my mind when I saw what was avalible.  the .img would let you have other files on the same drive, but not be as easy to work with"
2007-08-22T10:59:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,ok
2007-08-22T10:59:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"copy one drive to the other, now you have 2 borked drives.  try to fix one, and if you screw it up bad, just copy again"
2007-08-22T11:00:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,so because the b drive already has partisions on it when we move the data from c to b we'll be able to access the data.
2007-08-22T11:00:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,I get it
2007-08-22T11:00:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"well, that description isn't it"
2007-08-22T11:01:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,partitions are just the results of a few bytes near the beginnning of the drive that point to the start/size/type of each partition.  whack those bytes and you whack the partition _table_
2007-08-22T11:02:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,yea I get that
2007-08-22T11:02:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,I understand the idea of an mbr
2007-08-22T11:02:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250, so the copy will have the same junk
2007-08-22T11:03:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,i think so
2007-08-22T11:04:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,so dd if=/dev/sdc of=dev/sdb ?
2007-08-22T11:05:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,um... maybe.  will that copy the right thing to the right thing ?
2007-08-22T11:05:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,from c to b yes.
2007-08-22T11:05:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,let er rip
2007-08-22T11:07:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,that's going to take a while eh?
2007-08-22T11:07:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,yup
2007-08-22T11:07:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,you can get a progress like this.. (just a sec...)
2007-08-22T11:07:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,you could have taught me this as it was transfering.
2007-08-22T11:08:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250, that would be too late if it was wrong
2007-08-22T11:08:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,what should I see if it is working?
2007-08-22T11:08:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,nothing unless you do something... (looking that up)
2007-08-22T11:09:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,now to figure this out: man dd... Sending  a  USR1  signal  to  a running `dd' process makes it print I/O       statistics to standard error and then resume copying.
2007-08-22T11:09:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,soosh!
2007-08-22T11:09:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,woosh!
2007-08-22T11:10:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,that's the sound of all the text flying over my head.
2007-08-22T11:10:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,poke around and try to figure out the PID of the dd command that is running
2007-08-22T11:11:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,pid= process ID.  it shoudl be on something under the system menu
2007-08-22T11:13:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,I'm also trying to chat with my partner that is about 3888 km away while I'm trying to understand what your are teaching me.
2007-08-22T11:14:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,I just want to know if it's working or not.
2007-08-22T11:15:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"from a 2nd shell, need to send a signal to the dd process.  this is easy, once you know the  pid of the process... im dinking with how to find  it"
2007-08-22T11:16:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,I'm sorry if I'm being rude but I've lost all for the pictures with my partner and I and a lot of other info.  I wanted to try Linux but I keep messing my computer up when every I use Ubuntu.  SO I'm sorry if I'm a little impatient with this whole process.
2007-08-22T11:18:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,no prob.  open a 2nd shell and run top.  look down the list and find the dd command. look in the pid column and tell me the PID
2007-08-22T11:20:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,what is a shell?
2007-08-22T11:21:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"um, terminal?  the thing with the prompt were you can enter commands like man, dd"
2007-08-22T11:22:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,new tab or termanal?
2007-08-22T11:22:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,new term.
2007-08-22T11:23:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"ah, better than looking at top is: juser@e18:~$ ps auxw | grep ' dd '"
2007-08-22T11:24:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,woosh
2007-08-22T11:24:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,with '?
2007-08-22T11:25:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,yes.  my prompt: juser@e18:~$
2007-08-22T11:25:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,ok then what am I looking for in this sea of data?
2007-08-22T11:28:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,http://dpaste.com/17472/  5462 is the number we need on my box.  what is it on yours ?
2007-08-22T11:29:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,14561
2007-08-22T11:30:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,sudo kill -USR1 14561
2007-08-22T11:30:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,why?
2007-08-22T11:30:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,that will make dd display it's current byte counts
2007-08-22T11:32:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,I thought kill stopped something.
2007-08-22T11:32:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,man kill: kill - send a signal to a process  :)
2007-08-22T11:33:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,thanks for being my man
2007-08-22T11:33:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,lol
2007-08-22T11:33:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,14561 is not the pid of the dd command.
2007-08-22T11:34:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,and you didn't include the spaces in ' dd '
2007-08-22T11:34:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,lol
2007-08-22T11:34:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,shit
2007-08-22T11:37:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"got something like this yet: 137027837952 bytes (137 GB) copied, 407.613 seconds, 336 MB/s"
2007-08-22T11:38:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,I typed in ' if=/dev/sdc of=/dev/sdb and then nothing happened.

2007-08-22T11:40:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,come on carl I havn't accomplished anything yet and I've been sitting her for over an hour.
2007-08-22T11:40:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250," to send a signal to a process, you need the Process ID so you can tell kill what process to send the signal to.  (think email.)"

2007-08-22T11:42:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,just let me be your fingers.
2007-08-22T11:43:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,should I see someting?
2007-08-22T11:43:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250, I need you eyes too.
2007-08-22T11:43:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,yes.
2007-08-22T11:43:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,nothing after that line
2007-08-22T11:43:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250, what about the dd command ?
2007-08-22T11:44:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,http://dpaste.com/17476/
2007-08-22T11:44:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,what does 'in front' mean ?
2007-08-22T11:44:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,this is right before the sudo
2007-08-22T11:44:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,see the paste

2007-08-22T11:45:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,type this now!!!  sudo kill -USR1 14041
2007-08-22T11:46:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,I have.  See: http://dpaste.com/17476/
2007-08-22T11:46:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,yes master I did
2007-08-22T11:46:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,I will kill all
2007-08-22T11:47:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,and nothing happed.
2007-08-22T11:48:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,see no results.
2007-08-22T11:48:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,and no noisy HDS
2007-08-22T11:48:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,HDs
2007-08-22T11:48:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,:'(
2007-08-22T11:49:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,post the results of this again:  juser@e18:~$ ps auxw | grep ' dd '

2007-08-22T11:51:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,heh.  looks like it is done
2007-08-22T11:51:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,unplug both drives.  wait 5 sec.  plug in the 300
2007-08-22T11:51:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,wow that didn't take long considering there should be over 50Gbs of music and 50Gb of other pictures and stuff
2007-08-22T11:52:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"it has been over 1005.97 seconds, :)"
2007-08-22T11:53:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"it does seem kinda fast, so we will see what happened"

2007-08-22T11:53:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,post the output of fdisk -l
2007-08-22T11:54:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,is it done?
2007-08-22T11:55:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250, sudo gpart  /dev/sdc
2007-08-22T11:55:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,or should I compair it to the other drive?
2007-08-22T11:55:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"na, lets just see what we can recover.  if it looks like it was only 1/2 done, then go back and make the copy again"
2007-08-22T11:55:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,begin scan...
2007-08-22T11:56:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,what time is it where you are carl?
2007-08-22T11:57:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,past my bed time :)  1am
2007-08-22T12:00:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,here is what I get: http://dpaste.com/17477/
2007-08-22T12:00:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,"wow, how much later will you be here to guild my blind aXX"
2007-08-22T12:00:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,no much.  especially now that you made me look at the clock :)
2007-08-22T12:01:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,well if this works what's next?
2007-08-22T12:02:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,still scanning
2007-08-22T12:02:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"oh yeah, 300gig..."
2007-08-22T12:03:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,what did that origional list of drives look like?
2007-08-22T12:04:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,huh?
2007-08-22T12:04:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,can you paste it for me.
2007-08-22T12:04:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,the origional -l of the two drives.
2007-08-22T12:05:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,I'm not getting anything
2007-08-22T12:05:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,nm
2007-08-22T12:07:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,so by that it looks like the units are the same.  Does that mean everything was copied?
2007-08-22T12:10:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,no. that is just doing some math based on... um.. not really sure what.  physical drive spec.  fond somewhere
2007-08-22T12:11:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,ok
2007-08-22T12:12:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"now that I read man gpart, I see we should have used sudo gpart  /dev/sdc -W /dev/sdc"
2007-08-22T12:12:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,so what should I do?
2007-08-22T12:12:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,it's still scanning.
2007-08-22T12:14:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"let it keep scanning.  if it finds all the partitions, and all looks good, run it with the -W.  if it doesn't look good, then ... try the other 2 programs."
2007-08-22T12:14:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,ok great.
2007-08-22T12:14:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,so start from square 1
2007-08-22T12:15:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"actually, let me look at this more.  I know how to speed it up a bit"
2007-08-22T12:15:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,"I have a Centrino Duo, is the DVD using both processors?"
2007-08-22T12:16:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"yes.  run top, hit '1' which should show how much each cup is being used"
2007-08-22T12:17:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,nothing happened
2007-08-22T12:18:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,3rd line say cpu(s) or cpu0 ?
2007-08-22T12:19:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,then you didn't run top :)
2007-08-22T12:20:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,"run top, hit 'l'"
2007-08-22T12:20:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,I typed that
2007-08-22T12:21:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,Give me a little credit.
2007-08-22T12:21:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,I tryed with an without
2007-08-22T12:22:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,I typed top and I got stuff
2007-08-22T12:23:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250, good.  now press 1.  the 3rd line should change
2007-08-22T12:23:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK, are you talking about gpart?
2007-08-22T12:24:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,no.
2007-08-22T12:25:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,yea I see two Cpus
2007-08-22T12:26:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,63 sectors/track
2007-08-22T12:26:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,that is for 1 track.  how any for the whole disk?
2007-08-22T12:27:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,how do you find out how many tracks there are?
2007-08-22T12:29:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,there should be way more
2007-08-22T12:29:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,I had almost 60GBs of MP3s
2007-08-22T12:35:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,what should I do?
2007-08-22T12:35:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"my head is getting fuzzy, but here is what I got:  assuming total sectors is 255 * 63 * 19457 = 312576705, round up to 320 000 000, sudo gpart /dev/sdc -K 320000000 -W /dev/sdc"
2007-08-22T12:35:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,(^C to abort the current gpart run)
2007-08-22T12:37:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,didn't do anything
2007-08-22T12:37:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,the -K will keep it from scanning the 140 gig of the 300 that isn't part of the 160's bytes.  -W will prompt you to write out the part table it finds
2007-08-22T12:37:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,process didn't stop?
2007-08-22T12:38:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,what?
2007-08-22T12:39:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,you know what ^ is?
2007-08-22T12:39:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,no
2007-08-22T12:41:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,so do 'sudo gpart /dev/sdc -K 320000000 -W /dev/sdc'
2007-08-22T12:41:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,yup.
2007-08-22T12:41:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,ok
2007-08-22T12:41:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"on that note, I wish you the best.  im going to bed"
2007-08-22T12:42:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,We're still think that all didn't copy right?
2007-08-22T12:42:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"hard to say.  you have a fast box, not sure how fast usb2 can move 160 gig"
2007-08-22T12:43:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,Thanks for all your help CarlFK even thought most of what you tryed to teach me went woosh.  I thank you for at lease attemping to help me and not just posting links to the man and forums like others do.
2007-08-22T12:45:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"I would go back and note the few commands that you trred: dd and gpart are the main ones, if you want to see dd's progress, ps and kill.  if this doesn't work out, do it all again.  guessing because one of the kills killed it."
2007-08-22T12:46:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,Will do
2007-08-22T12:46:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"oh yeah, fdisk too.  cuz the /dev/sdx may not be the same if you un/plug the drive"
2007-08-22T12:46:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,ok
2007-08-22T12:46:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,take care.  Have a good sleep
2007-08-22T12:47:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,Thanks again
2007-08-22T12:51:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,can I format my laptops hd at the same time I'm doing the scan?

2007-08-22T09:18:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,thanks
2007-08-22T09:18:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,can a noob use this?
2007-08-22T09:19:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,sure.  do you know how to image the whole drive?
2007-08-22T09:19:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,not using Ubuntu
2007-08-22T09:20:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250, how big is the drive that got trashed?
2007-08-22T09:20:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,weee!!!   got 160gb free somewhere?
2007-08-22T09:20:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,yep
2007-08-22T09:21:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,will this recover from ext3 aswell?
2007-08-22T09:21:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,yay.  dd if=/dev/hda of=/path/to/lots/of/space/hda.img
2007-08-22T09:22:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,ouch
2007-08-22T09:22:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,what?
2007-08-22T09:22:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"hda.img will be a 160gig file, so make sure where ever you are storing that can hold it"
2007-08-22T09:22:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,the free space is a drive that I tryed to install ubuntu but it didn't work.
2007-08-22T09:23:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,yep
2007-08-22T09:23:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,got a 300 gb USB drive
2007-08-22T09:23:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"hope it is usb2, else it is gonna take days or weeks :)"
2007-08-22T09:23:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,yes
2007-08-22T09:24:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"there is something worth hours of time trying to save, right ?"
2007-08-22T09:24:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,how do I formate a drive so that I can use it for this purpose and then but the recovered files on to a NTFS drive.
2007-08-22T09:24:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,yes
2007-08-22T09:25:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"format as ext2 (mke2fs), then use http://www.fs-driver.org to read/write from win"
2007-08-22T09:26:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,OK i KNOW HOW TO USE fs
2007-08-22T09:27:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,but how do I formate the 300GB drive using ubuntu. I have limited use of this OS I was trying to learn and it had cause me many leters of tears
2007-08-22T09:27:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,on the 300gb hd is a botch attempt to install Ubuntu
2007-08-22T09:28:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,you need to figure out what 'device' it is. proably /dev/sda (use dmesg to verify that)  sudo mke2fs /dev/sda1
2007-08-22T09:28:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"mk..fs is Make FS, exactly what dos format does"
2007-08-22T09:29:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,what is this about ntfs ?
2007-08-22T09:30:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,NTFS is what is on another USB drive that I will want to move the recovered files to.
2007-08-22T09:31:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,I have no clue how well the ntfs write support is.  so I would write to ext2 and use the ext2 win driver to read from win and write to ntfs
2007-08-22T09:31:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,ok
2007-08-22T09:31:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,yes ext3
2007-08-22T09:32:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,so how do I do this recover?
2007-08-22T09:33:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250, no clue.  I seem to remember using it about a year to :)
2007-08-22T09:33:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,"oh crap, well I though I installed the program you gave me but I can't find it."
2007-08-22T09:34:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,it's find I can read ext3 using that program you suggested.  i HAVE done that before.
2007-08-22T09:34:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,fine
2007-08-22T09:35:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,how do I find the recover program?
2007-08-22T09:37:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,"yep I've used it, but I can't fine that damn recover program."
2007-08-22T09:37:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,it is in the universe repo - understand that ?
2007-08-22T09:38:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,where is that?
2007-08-22T09:38:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,nope I don't under stand sorry
2007-08-22T09:39:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"syn... package manger, settings, repos"

2007-08-22T09:44:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,were you talking about Downloadable from the internet?
2007-08-22T09:44:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250, hit 'reload' wait... hit 'search' and type 'reover'
2007-08-22T09:44:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,yes
2007-08-22T09:45:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,good.  now to figure out how to use it :)

2007-08-22T09:46:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,ok upgraded
2007-08-22T09:46:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"find/install gpart 'Guess PC disk partition table, find lost partitions'"
2007-08-22T09:47:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,ok installed
2007-08-22T09:48:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,might as well get this too:  TestDisk Partition scanner and disk recovery tool
2007-08-22T09:49:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,ok onde
2007-08-22T09:49:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,done
2007-08-22T09:50:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,im booting up a 2nd box to experiment on... and gegting a drink.  just a sec

2007-08-22T09:57:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,ok
2007-08-22T09:59:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,"so I just want to lay things out for you again.  I have 3 USB HDs, and my laptop HD (witch won't be part of the recovery).  The usb drive that has the files on it that needs to be recovered is 160 GB, the second drive is 300GB ext3 with a messed up install of ubuntu, the 3rd USB drive is 500GB NTFS drive with my backups on it."
2007-08-22T10:00:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,oh and I'm currently using the ubuntu DVD.
2007-08-22T10:01:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,some how figure out the /dev/ of each usb drive.  lsusb and dmesg|less should be enough
2007-08-22T10:02:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK, only 2 of the drives are connected right now 160 and 300gb
2007-08-22T10:02:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,oh and I have no idea what you were asking me to do.
2007-08-22T10:03:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"heh.  actually, this should get the /dev/ info: fdisk -l"
2007-08-22T10:03:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,???
2007-08-22T10:03:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,what is /dev/
2007-08-22T10:04:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"man fdisk,  ' -l     List  the  partition  tables ...  '  will show you things like 'Disk /dev/sdc: 16 MB, 16384000 bytes'"
2007-08-22T10:04:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250, /dev/ is how linux gives you 'access' to devices.
2007-08-22T10:05:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,windows isn't working right nw.
2007-08-22T10:05:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"the drivers define the final name.  /dev/hda is Hard Disk A, /dev/sda1 is Scsi Disk A, partition 1"
2007-08-22T10:05:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,whats that got to do with anything ?
2007-08-22T10:06:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,fdisk
2007-08-22T10:06:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,fdisk was a unix command first :)
2007-08-22T10:06:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,??
2007-08-22T10:07:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,/dev/hda1 is 'close' to dos/window's C:

2007-08-22T10:17:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"which partition ?  sdb1, sdb2 or sdb3 ?"
2007-08-22T10:17:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"hang on, I need to take notes ... :)"
2007-08-22T10:18:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,can I copy the info on the termanal some how for you?

2007-08-22T10:22:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,nope
2007-08-22T10:24:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,make sure you understand what this next does.  double check my work (you know the man command?).  cuz this is a dozy: dd if=/dev/sdc of=/dev/sdb
2007-08-22T10:25:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,nope I don't know the man command.

2007-08-22T10:26:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,ok what do we need that for?
2007-08-22T10:27:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250, to make sure the dangerous commands are done right
2007-08-22T10:28:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,ok just tell me what to do and I'll try my best to fallow your instructions oh wise CarlFK.
2007-08-22T10:28:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"do this, all of it: make sure you understand what this next does.  double check my work (you know the man command?).  cuz this is a dozy: dd if=/dev/sdc of=/dev/sdb"
2007-08-22T10:30:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,so you want me to do dd if=/dev/sdc of=dev/sdb?
2007-08-22T10:30:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,is that one command?
2007-08-22T10:30:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,only if you can tell me what it does :)
2007-08-22T10:31:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,ah shit
2007-08-22T10:32:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,ok give me about 5 min to find the info.

2007-08-22T10:36:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,what about it?
2007-08-22T10:36:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,do you know what line the info is I'm looking for?
2007-08-22T10:37:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,no.  you need to read and understand.  ideally tell me what the command I gave you is gonna do
2007-08-22T10:37:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,yes master
2007-08-22T10:37:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,what was the command again?

2007-08-22T10:39:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,Ill throw you a bone: /dev/ things are/arn't files depending on who you ask.
2007-08-22T10:39:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"what is important is to understand what they do: they are a reference to a device, and can read/write to the devise just like you read/write to a file."

2007-08-22T10:43:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,so you're trying to teach me about man?
2007-08-22T10:43:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,yeah.  that should take you about 20 seconds.  (don't read the whole man man page)
2007-08-22T10:44:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,get on to man dd
2007-08-22T10:45:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,what does this mean?http://dpaste.com/17472/
2007-08-22T10:46:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,it means if you type 'man dd' you will get the manual page for dd :)
2007-08-22T10:48:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,dd - conver and copy a file
2007-08-22T10:48:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,ah that's it?
2007-08-22T10:48:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,getting close.
2007-08-22T10:51:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,copy from drive ...
2007-08-22T10:52:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,copy from this drive to another.
2007-08-22T10:53:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,yup.  did I get the drives right?
2007-08-22T10:53:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,i DON'T REMEMBER now.
2007-08-22T10:54:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,dd if=/dev/X of=/dev/Y  (you get figure out X and Y)
2007-08-22T10:55:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,x=c y=b
2007-08-22T10:55:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,but as you can see the c drive has no partision
2007-08-22T10:56:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,your going to help me recover it right?
2007-08-22T10:56:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,/dev/sdb is the whole drive.  /dev/sdb1 would be the first partition
2007-08-22T10:56:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,master
2007-08-22T10:56:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,yep
2007-08-22T10:56:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"yeah, and given the drives you have, we can make a backup, and then try to recover the backup"
2007-08-22T10:57:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,I don't under stand
2007-08-22T10:57:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,it's the c drive that we are trying to recover the files from.
2007-08-22T10:57:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,yet it has no partision
2007-08-22T10:57:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,dd if=/dev/sdc of=/dev/sdb = copy all of one drive to the other drive (including partition tables
2007-08-22T10:58:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,sounds good
2007-08-22T10:58:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,drives are just big wads of bytes.  don't need any partitions or files right now.  just gonna move all the bytes from input to output
2007-08-22T10:58:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,but I thought we had to make an img?
2007-08-22T10:59:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"I was, but changed my mind when I saw what was avalible.  the .img would let you have other files on the same drive, but not be as easy to work with"
2007-08-22T10:59:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,ok
2007-08-22T10:59:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"copy one drive to the other, now you have 2 borked drives.  try to fix one, and if you screw it up bad, just copy again"
2007-08-22T11:00:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,so because the b drive already has partisions on it when we move the data from c to b we'll be able to access the data.
2007-08-22T11:00:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,I get it
2007-08-22T11:00:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"well, that description isn't it"
2007-08-22T11:01:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,partitions are just the results of a few bytes near the beginnning of the drive that point to the start/size/type of each partition.  whack those bytes and you whack the partition _table_
2007-08-22T11:02:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,yea I get that
2007-08-22T11:02:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,I understand the idea of an mbr
2007-08-22T11:02:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250, so the copy will have the same junk
2007-08-22T11:03:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,i think so
2007-08-22T11:04:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,so dd if=/dev/sdc of=dev/sdb ?
2007-08-22T11:05:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,um... maybe.  will that copy the right thing to the right thing ?
2007-08-22T11:05:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,from c to b yes.
2007-08-22T11:05:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,let er rip
2007-08-22T11:07:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,that's going to take a while eh?
2007-08-22T11:07:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,yup
2007-08-22T11:07:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,you can get a progress like this.. (just a sec...)
2007-08-22T11:07:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,you could have taught me this as it was transfering.
2007-08-22T11:08:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250, that would be too late if it was wrong
2007-08-22T11:08:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,what should I see if it is working?
2007-08-22T11:08:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,nothing unless you do something... (looking that up)
2007-08-22T11:09:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,now to figure this out: man dd... Sending  a  USR1  signal  to  a running `dd' process makes it print I/O       statistics to standard error and then resume copying.
2007-08-22T11:09:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,soosh!
2007-08-22T11:09:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,woosh!
2007-08-22T11:10:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,that's the sound of all the text flying over my head.
2007-08-22T11:10:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,poke around and try to figure out the PID of the dd command that is running
2007-08-22T11:11:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,pid= process ID.  it shoudl be on something under the system menu
2007-08-22T11:13:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,I'm also trying to chat with my partner that is about 3888 km away while I'm trying to understand what your are teaching me.
2007-08-22T11:14:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,I just want to know if it's working or not.
2007-08-22T11:15:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"from a 2nd shell, need to send a signal to the dd process.  this is easy, once you know the  pid of the process... im dinking with how to find  it"
2007-08-22T11:16:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,I'm sorry if I'm being rude but I've lost all for the pictures with my partner and I and a lot of other info.  I wanted to try Linux but I keep messing my computer up when every I use Ubuntu.  SO I'm sorry if I'm a little impatient with this whole process.
2007-08-22T11:18:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,no prob.  open a 2nd shell and run top.  look down the list and find the dd command. look in the pid column and tell me the PID
2007-08-22T11:20:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,what is a shell?
2007-08-22T11:21:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"um, terminal?  the thing with the prompt were you can enter commands like man, dd"
2007-08-22T11:22:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,new tab or termanal?
2007-08-22T11:22:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,new term.
2007-08-22T11:23:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"ah, better than looking at top is: juser@e18:~$ ps auxw | grep ' dd '"
2007-08-22T11:24:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,woosh
2007-08-22T11:24:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,with '?
2007-08-22T11:25:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,yes.  my prompt: juser@e18:~$
2007-08-22T11:25:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,ok then what am I looking for in this sea of data?
2007-08-22T11:28:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,http://dpaste.com/17472/  5462 is the number we need on my box.  what is it on yours ?
2007-08-22T11:29:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,14561
2007-08-22T11:30:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,sudo kill -USR1 14561
2007-08-22T11:30:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,why?
2007-08-22T11:30:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,that will make dd display it's current byte counts
2007-08-22T11:32:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,I thought kill stopped something.
2007-08-22T11:32:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,man kill: kill - send a signal to a process  :)
2007-08-22T11:33:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,thanks for being my man
2007-08-22T11:33:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,lol
2007-08-22T11:33:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,14561 is not the pid of the dd command.
2007-08-22T11:34:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,and you didn't include the spaces in ' dd '
2007-08-22T11:34:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,lol
2007-08-22T11:34:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,shit
2007-08-22T11:37:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"got something like this yet: 137027837952 bytes (137 GB) copied, 407.613 seconds, 336 MB/s"
2007-08-22T11:38:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,I typed in ' if=/dev/sdc of=/dev/sdb and then nothing happened.
2007-08-22T11:39:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,cuz you haven't 'Sending  a  USR1  signal  to  a running `dd' process' using 'kill - send a signal to a process'  :)

2007-08-22T11:40:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,come on carl I havn't accomplished anything yet and I've been sitting her for over an hour.
2007-08-22T11:40:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250," to send a signal to a process, you need the Process ID so you can tell kill what process to send the signal to.  (think email.)"

2007-08-22T11:42:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,so what do you want me to type next?

2007-08-22T11:42:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,just let me be your fingers.
2007-08-22T11:43:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,should I see someting?
2007-08-22T11:43:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250, I need you eyes too.
2007-08-22T11:43:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,yes.
2007-08-22T11:43:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,nothing after that line
2007-08-22T11:43:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250, what about the dd command ?
2007-08-22T11:44:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,http://dpaste.com/17476/
2007-08-22T11:44:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,what does 'in front' mean ?
2007-08-22T11:44:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,this is right before the sudo
2007-08-22T11:44:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,see the paste

2007-08-22T11:45:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,type this now!!!  sudo kill -USR1 14041
2007-08-22T11:46:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,I have.  See: http://dpaste.com/17476/
2007-08-22T11:46:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,yes master I did
2007-08-22T11:46:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,I will kill all
2007-08-22T11:47:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,and nothing happed.
2007-08-22T11:48:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,see no results.
2007-08-22T11:48:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,and no noisy HDS
2007-08-22T11:48:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,HDs
2007-08-22T11:48:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,:'(
2007-08-22T11:49:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,post the results of this again:  juser@e18:~$ ps auxw | grep ' dd '

2007-08-22T11:51:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,heh.  looks like it is done
2007-08-22T11:51:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,unplug both drives.  wait 5 sec.  plug in the 300
2007-08-22T11:51:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,wow that didn't take long considering there should be over 50Gbs of music and 50Gb of other pictures and stuff
2007-08-22T11:52:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"it has been over 1005.97 seconds, :)"
2007-08-22T11:53:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"it does seem kinda fast, so we will see what happened"

2007-08-22T11:53:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,post the output of fdisk -l
2007-08-22T11:54:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,is it done?
2007-08-22T11:55:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250, sudo gpart  /dev/sdc
2007-08-22T11:55:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,or should I compair it to the other drive?
2007-08-22T11:55:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"na, lets just see what we can recover.  if it looks like it was only 1/2 done, then go back and make the copy again"
2007-08-22T11:55:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,begin scan...
2007-08-22T11:56:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,what time is it where you are carl?
2007-08-22T11:57:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,past my bed time :)  1am
2007-08-22T12:00:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,here is what I get: http://dpaste.com/17477/
2007-08-22T12:00:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,"wow, how much later will you be here to guild my blind aXX"
2007-08-22T12:00:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,no much.  especially now that you made me look at the clock :)
2007-08-22T12:01:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,well if this works what's next?
2007-08-22T12:02:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,still scanning
2007-08-22T12:02:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"oh yeah, 300gig..."
2007-08-22T12:03:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,what did that origional list of drives look like?
2007-08-22T12:04:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,huh?
2007-08-22T12:04:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,can you paste it for me.
2007-08-22T12:04:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,the origional -l of the two drives.
2007-08-22T12:05:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,I'm not getting anything
2007-08-22T12:05:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,nm
2007-08-22T12:07:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,so by that it looks like the units are the same.  Does that mean everything was copied?
2007-08-22T12:10:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,no. that is just doing some math based on... um.. not really sure what.  physical drive spec.  fond somewhere
2007-08-22T12:11:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,ok
2007-08-22T12:12:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"now that I read man gpart, I see we should have used sudo gpart  /dev/sdc -W /dev/sdc"
2007-08-22T12:12:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,so what should I do?
2007-08-22T12:12:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,it's still scanning.
2007-08-22T12:14:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"let it keep scanning.  if it finds all the partitions, and all looks good, run it with the -W.  if it doesn't look good, then ... try the other 2 programs."
2007-08-22T12:14:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,ok great.
2007-08-22T12:14:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,so start from square 1
2007-08-22T12:15:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"actually, let me look at this more.  I know how to speed it up a bit"
2007-08-22T12:15:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,"I have a Centrino Duo, is the DVD using both processors?"
2007-08-22T12:16:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"yes.  run top, hit '1' which should show how much each cup is being used"
2007-08-22T12:17:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,nothing happened
2007-08-22T12:18:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,3rd line say cpu(s) or cpu0 ?
2007-08-22T12:19:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,then you didn't run top :)
2007-08-22T12:20:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,"run top, hit 'l'"
2007-08-22T12:20:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,I typed that
2007-08-22T12:21:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,Give me a little credit.
2007-08-22T12:21:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,I tryed with an without
2007-08-22T12:22:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,I typed top and I got stuff
2007-08-22T12:23:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250, good.  now press 1.  the 3rd line should change
2007-08-22T12:23:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK, are you talking about gpart?
2007-08-22T12:24:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,no.
2007-08-22T12:25:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,yea I see two Cpus
2007-08-22T12:26:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,63 sectors/track
2007-08-22T12:26:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,that is for 1 track.  how any for the whole disk?
2007-08-22T12:27:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,how do you find out how many tracks there are?
2007-08-22T12:29:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,there should be way more
2007-08-22T12:29:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,I had almost 60GBs of MP3s
2007-08-22T12:35:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,what should I do?
2007-08-22T12:35:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"my head is getting fuzzy, but here is what I got:  assuming total sectors is 255 * 63 * 19457 = 312576705, round up to 320 000 000, sudo gpart /dev/sdc -K 320000000 -W /dev/sdc"
2007-08-22T12:35:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,(^C to abort the current gpart run)
2007-08-22T12:37:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,didn't do anything
2007-08-22T12:37:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,the -K will keep it from scanning the 140 gig of the 300 that isn't part of the 160's bytes.  -W will prompt you to write out the part table it finds
2007-08-22T12:37:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,process didn't stop?
2007-08-22T12:38:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,what?
2007-08-22T12:39:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,you know what ^ is?
2007-08-22T12:39:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,no
2007-08-22T12:41:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,so do 'sudo gpart /dev/sdc -K 320000000 -W /dev/sdc'
2007-08-22T12:41:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,yup.
2007-08-22T12:41:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,ok
2007-08-22T12:41:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"on that note, I wish you the best.  im going to bed"
2007-08-22T12:42:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,We're still think that all didn't copy right?
2007-08-22T12:42:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"hard to say.  you have a fast box, not sure how fast usb2 can move 160 gig"
2007-08-22T12:43:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,Thanks for all your help CarlFK even thought most of what you tryed to teach me went woosh.  I thank you for at lease attemping to help me and not just posting links to the man and forums like others do.
2007-08-22T12:45:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"I would go back and note the few commands that you trred: dd and gpart are the main ones, if you want to see dd's progress, ps and kill.  if this doesn't work out, do it all again.  guessing because one of the kills killed it."
2007-08-22T12:46:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,Will do
2007-08-22T12:46:00.000Z,CarlFK,Andrew250,"oh yeah, fdisk too.  cuz the /dev/sdx may not be the same if you un/plug the drive"
2007-08-22T12:46:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,ok
2007-08-22T12:46:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,take care.  Have a good sleep
2007-08-22T12:47:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,Thanks again
2007-08-22T12:51:00.000Z,Andrew250,CarlFK,can I format my laptops hd at the same time I'm doing the scan?
