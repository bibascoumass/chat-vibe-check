2010-05-18T17:22:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, i just use the Player name of 'Target' now a days. :)
2010-05-18T17:23:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,used to play diablo2 with my mate as a sorc and she was called 'bait'. run over to stuff to bring stuff back for my barb to kill
2010-05-20T20:46:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,ext2 is good on USB / flash based devices
2010-05-22T22:08:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,yeah something like that
2010-06-15T06:39:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,"crazy stuff, is there a grub option to wait a bit?"
2010-06-15T06:39:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, thats what im wondering.. but this is a NEW install.. lets try a update/upgrade. and see if theres a newer kernel version. that might fix the issue
2010-06-15T06:40:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,"i'd ask in #grub too, let me check (fresh install of lubuntu here)"
2010-06-15T06:41:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,you may have to have the grub menu onscreen a little while stuff mounts
2010-06-15T06:43:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,codebrainz: having grub onscreen longer may get the drive ready to be mounted and such (spinup). Does it only happen on cold boot?
2010-06-15T06:45:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, Not sure - havent tested it enoguht to notice.  I dident notice this issue with the old hd. but htis is a newer 1.5tb i just tossed in.
2010-06-27T12:08:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,was typing that (slowly)
2010-07-03T11:13:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, but the terminal is 'scary'! :)
2010-07-03T11:13:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,totally
2010-07-03T11:13:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,I bet his other pc is a mac
2010-07-03T23:30:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,sounds like copyrighted material asking for a 'plugin' to me
2010-07-03T23:31:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, yep. but ive seen 'warez/mal-videos' also act likw that.
2010-07-03T23:32:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,its usually some encoder (+malware) which misses certail patterns of bits. If you can find out the pattern etc you can retrieve the video
2010-07-08T16:28:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,noatime is ood for speed boots (a tiny bit)
2010-07-08T16:36:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,i doubt it ;)
2010-07-08T16:37:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, lets go file a bug on the backtrack forums/bug thing then. ;)
2010-07-08T16:37:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,"never uderstood it, you can install ubuntu then instal all the garbage which makes up a backtrack install and get support in the official cannel."
2010-07-08T18:32:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, aparently the Dock station does.. or somthing :)
2010-07-09T21:51:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,not so good for a minimal install dude ;)
2010-07-09T21:51:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, he never said he wanted to keep it minimal... :)
2010-07-09T21:51:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,i'm guessing with the use of the minimal iso
2010-07-09T21:52:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip," i have to wonder at  the 'i know i want a minimal install, but dont know how to install things'  logic.. :)"
2010-07-12T19:54:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,its a pretty for grub

2010-07-16T22:14:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, its not dedicated to just irc.
2010-07-16T22:15:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,doesnt mean its not a client though
2010-07-25T01:45:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,can I PM please dude?
2010-07-25T01:46:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, go ahead. but im cooking supper. :)

2010-07-25T22:13:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,yeah theres still a few niggles though
2010-07-26T22:37:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,not bad considering most windows games are several gb installed
2010-08-08T02:52:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, with enough files taht can overload teh command line buffer for bash i recall. (command line too long)
2010-08-08T02:52:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, i was thinking 'echo *.txt' but that has the same issue.. :)
2010-08-23T06:24:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,good call
2010-08-23T06:23:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,the wonders of the HCL eh ;)

2010-08-29T12:14:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, best advice - forget mIRC - check out other irc clients
2010-08-29T12:15:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,"never used it, never will. I used to use hydrairc"
2010-08-29T12:15:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,also free :)

2010-10-03T20:41:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,true but terminal is 'scary' for them right... Catch 22
2010-10-03T20:41:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip,  they can do less damage with the terminal. :)
2010-10-03T20:42:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,"dunno, typos exist"
2010-10-03T20:43:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, of course in this case tremouls proberly can have its addons in the users /home/username/.tremeolus directory.... so altering system dirs is proberly not needed
2010-10-04T18:58:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,use the guide to make it use fb driver til you hit the desktop ;) works great
2010-10-04T18:57:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,works for me ;)
2010-10-04T18:57:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, it works better at shutdown for me then it does at bootup
2010-10-04T18:58:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, i have better luck witjh disabling the fb console totally.

2010-11-02T11:31:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,"not sure, worth a looksee"

2011-02-13T13:57:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,the sound will play locally though (without tweaking)
2011-02-13T13:58:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, ive had the wife do that to me.. she was playing pacman over vnc.. and i was hearing the noise down here.. (and i was sleeping at the time) heh.

2011-02-27T17:43:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,it all goes through the same hub so a different controller may make it a bit smoother
2011-02-27T17:43:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,worth a play :)
2011-03-02T00:28:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,yeah the factoid gives the repo

2011-03-06T14:35:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, or did i miss a checkbox/setting somewhere to make it allways restart that?
2011-03-06T14:35:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,"bizarre, you got transdroid all good too? :)"
2011-03-06T14:35:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,not sure I just run it and the options stick
2011-03-06T14:36:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, I am running vlc on a windows box as my test. so that may be why.
2011-03-06T14:36:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,enable the web ui in transmission and then connect using transdroid. Click a torrent in the browser and the torrent is told to download on your PC

2012-05-22T22:29:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, just trying to figure out how it decides what frame to use. thoght it was an id3 tag or somthing.
2012-05-22T22:29:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, noticed if i reencode the video - it often changes
2012-05-22T22:30:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,"not sure tbh. Maybe its random. Could clear the thumbnails, see if the same is chosen"
2012-05-22T22:31:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, i wa thinking it was like 10 sec into the video.. but havent seen any rhyme to it.

2010-05-18T17:22:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, i just use the Player name of 'Target' now a days. :)
2010-05-18T17:23:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,used to play diablo2 with my mate as a sorc and she was called 'bait'. run over to stuff to bring stuff back for my barb to kill
2010-05-20T20:46:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,ext2 is good on USB / flash based devices
2010-05-22T22:08:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,yeah something like that
2010-06-15T06:39:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,"crazy stuff, is there a grub option to wait a bit?"
2010-06-15T06:39:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, thats what im wondering.. but this is a NEW install.. lets try a update/upgrade. and see if theres a newer kernel version. that might fix the issue
2010-06-15T06:40:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,"i'd ask in #grub too, let me check (fresh install of lubuntu here)"
2010-06-15T06:41:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,you may have to have the grub menu onscreen a little while stuff mounts
2010-06-15T06:43:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,codebrainz: having grub onscreen longer may get the drive ready to be mounted and such (spinup). Does it only happen on cold boot?
2010-06-15T06:45:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, Not sure - havent tested it enoguht to notice.  I dident notice this issue with the old hd. but htis is a newer 1.5tb i just tossed in.
2010-06-27T12:08:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,was typing that (slowly)
2010-07-03T11:13:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, but the terminal is 'scary'! :)
2010-07-03T11:13:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,totally
2010-07-03T11:13:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,I bet his other pc is a mac
2010-07-03T23:30:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,sounds like copyrighted material asking for a 'plugin' to me
2010-07-03T23:31:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, yep. but ive seen 'warez/mal-videos' also act likw that.
2010-07-03T23:32:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,its usually some encoder (+malware) which misses certail patterns of bits. If you can find out the pattern etc you can retrieve the video
2010-07-08T16:28:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,noatime is ood for speed boots (a tiny bit)
2010-07-08T16:36:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,i doubt it ;)
2010-07-08T16:37:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, lets go file a bug on the backtrack forums/bug thing then. ;)
2010-07-08T16:37:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,"never uderstood it, you can install ubuntu then instal all the garbage which makes up a backtrack install and get support in the official cannel."
2010-07-08T18:32:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, aparently the Dock station does.. or somthing :)
2010-07-09T21:51:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,not so good for a minimal install dude ;)
2010-07-09T21:51:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, he never said he wanted to keep it minimal... :)
2010-07-09T21:51:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,i'm guessing with the use of the minimal iso
2010-07-09T21:52:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip," i have to wonder at  the 'i know i want a minimal install, but dont know how to install things'  logic.. :)"
2010-07-12T19:54:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,its a pretty for grub
2010-07-12T19:54:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, ive seen  the name. :) but never really looked into it.

2010-07-16T22:14:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,it is an irc client
2010-07-16T22:14:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, its not dedicated to just irc.
2010-07-16T22:15:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,doesnt mean its not a client though
2010-07-25T01:45:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,can I PM please dude?
2010-07-25T01:46:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, go ahead. but im cooking supper. :)

2010-07-25T22:13:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,yeah theres still a few niggles though
2010-07-26T22:37:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,not bad considering most windows games are several gb installed
2010-08-08T02:52:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, with enough files taht can overload teh command line buffer for bash i recall. (command line too long)
2010-08-08T02:52:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, i was thinking 'echo *.txt' but that has the same issue.. :)
2010-08-23T06:24:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,good call
2010-08-23T06:23:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,the wonders of the HCL eh ;)

2010-08-23T06:43:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, i always point mine at the fishtank :)
2010-08-29T09:22:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,bit hacky but would work
2010-08-29T11:03:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,thats what I tought
2010-08-29T12:14:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, best advice - forget mIRC - check out other irc clients
2010-08-29T12:15:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,"never used it, never will. I used to use hydrairc"
2010-08-29T12:15:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,also free :)

2010-10-03T20:41:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,true but terminal is 'scary' for them right... Catch 22
2010-10-03T20:41:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip,  they can do less damage with the terminal. :)
2010-10-03T20:42:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,"dunno, typos exist"
2010-10-03T20:43:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, of course in this case tremouls proberly can have its addons in the users /home/username/.tremeolus directory.... so altering system dirs is proberly not needed
2010-10-04T18:58:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,use the guide to make it use fb driver til you hit the desktop ;) works great
2010-10-04T18:57:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,works for me ;)
2010-10-04T18:57:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, it works better at shutdown for me then it does at bootup
2010-10-04T18:58:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, i have better luck witjh disabling the fb console totally.

2010-11-02T11:30:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, that would mean they redid their assembly code. :)  or some how did some tricks to it.
2010-11-02T11:31:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,"not sure, worth a looksee"
2010-11-02T11:33:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,I'm currently dead but have 4 days of break now :)

2010-11-24T20:18:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, I put an Apple Sticker on my Toshiba laptop. :) does that count.
2010-11-24T20:20:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,"hahaha definately, probably runs the same speed and cost half the price"
2010-12-18T23:37:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, have you ever seen any actual benchmarks on that? Ive never seen any 'proof' :) then again ive never had a flash drive go bad either no matter what fs i use

2011-01-17T14:24:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,last I saw they only made 32bit...
2011-01-17T14:25:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,"hmm, interesting thought"
2011-01-17T14:25:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,yeah I think thats where I was going with the Canon stuff

2011-02-12T23:28:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, i thought i saw somwe update yesterday about flash.. but been to busy to even check it out. :)
2011-02-13T13:57:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,the sound will play locally though (without tweaking)
2011-02-13T13:58:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, ive had the wife do that to me.. she was playing pacman over vnc.. and i was hearing the noise down here.. (and i was sleeping at the time) heh.

2011-02-27T17:42:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, for that machine yes.
2011-02-27T17:43:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,it all goes through the same hub so a different controller may make it a bit smoother
2011-02-27T17:43:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,worth a play :)
2011-03-02T00:28:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,yeah the factoid gives the repo

2011-03-06T14:34:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,"I control VLC as it has a remote interface, you just browse the files on the phone and tell it to play it rather than waving the mouse pointer around"
2011-03-06T14:35:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, Yep. got that working yesterday also.  I did n otice i had to keep reenabling the 'web interface' for vlc. Couldent figure out how to make vlc enable the web interface by default on restart.
2011-03-06T14:35:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, or did i miss a checkbox/setting somewhere to make it allways restart that?
2011-03-06T14:35:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,"bizarre, you got transdroid all good too? :)"
2011-03-06T14:35:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,not sure I just run it and the options stick
2011-03-06T14:36:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, I am running vlc on a windows box as my test. so that may be why.
2011-03-06T14:36:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,enable the web ui in transmission and then connect using transdroid. Click a torrent in the browser and the torrent is told to download on your PC

2012-05-22T22:29:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,could grab an image and change the icon for that file to whatever you want
2012-05-22T22:29:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, just trying to figure out how it decides what frame to use. thoght it was an id3 tag or somthing.
2012-05-22T22:29:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, noticed if i reencode the video - it often changes
2012-05-22T22:30:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,Dr_Willis,"not sure tbh. Maybe its random. Could clear the thumbnails, see if the same is chosen"
2012-05-22T22:31:00.000Z,Dr_Willis,ActionParsnip, i wa thinking it was like 10 sec into the video.. but havent seen any rhyme to it.
