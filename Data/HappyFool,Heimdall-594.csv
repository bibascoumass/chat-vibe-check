2005-06-25T16:52:00.000Z,HappyFool,,good night ;)
2005-06-25T05:42:00.000Z,HappyFool,,there's nothing in the gdm logs (/var/log/gdm/*) or ~/.xsession-errors ?
2005-06-25T05:44:00.000Z,HappyFool,,hey Heimdall -- any luck with your modem?
2005-06-25T05:45:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: well no... :(
2005-06-25T05:45:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,hm
2005-06-25T05:45:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,how far did you get?
2005-06-25T05:46:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: well I didn't go so far... but I installed all we spoke about
2005-06-25T05:46:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: I begin to have serious doubts
2005-06-25T05:47:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,why's that?
2005-06-25T05:47:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,": well... I think I have installed all, but it still dont detect the modem"
2005-06-25T05:50:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,:I installed the source and dameon package
2005-06-25T05:50:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: and it seems to be successful
2005-06-25T05:50:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,ok. and the build? (make-kpkg) ?
2005-06-25T05:51:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: hum... this I don't know very well what it does
2005-06-25T05:51:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,i'm actually just trying to install the created deb and it's refusing. odd
2005-06-25T05:51:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"well, there's a build step"
2005-06-25T05:52:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,it's not enough to just install the source
2005-06-25T05:52:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: I admit that I'm quite lost with all of these things to do
2005-06-25T05:52:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"yeah, i guess it is a bit of an information overload"
2005-06-25T05:53:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: I typed lspci and it told me SiS AC'97 modem controller
2005-06-25T05:53:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,ah
2005-06-25T05:53:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,heh. so all this might be for nothing ? ;)
2005-06-25T05:54:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,never fear! there is a neat little script available from here: http://linmodems.technion.ac.il/ that should tell you what driver you need
2005-06-25T05:54:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,": hummm I'm not sure, because... I search on the web with this reference, and I found something about smartlink modem too"
2005-06-25T05:55:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: do u know windows ?
2005-06-25T05:55:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"err, a little"
2005-06-25T05:55:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: well; it tells me thah mymodem is a smartlink
2005-06-25T05:56:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,then it probably is a smart link
2005-06-25T05:56:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,": so, I did dpkg -i for the source and daemon .deb"
2005-06-25T05:58:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"ok, you also need to install kernel-package and module-assistant (both downloaded debs)"
2005-06-25T05:59:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,": actually, now I can make tests, it is easier since I'm not on my laptop anymore"
2005-06-25T05:59:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: I think it is done
2005-06-25T06:00:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,ok
2005-06-25T06:00:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,so you can work there now without leaving irc?
2005-06-25T06:00:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,": yes, I have my laptop right next to me"
2005-06-25T06:00:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,excellent
2005-06-25T06:00:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,let me know when you get to a command prompt
2005-06-25T06:01:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,heh -- good stuff
2005-06-25T06:03:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: modify the grub command wasn't difficult with a good graphic editor ;)
2005-06-25T06:05:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,gedit?
2005-06-25T06:06:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"yeah, package install thingy. System -> Administration -> Synaptic"
2005-06-25T06:07:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,synaptic is a little better when you have an internet connection though ;)
2005-06-25T06:07:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,ok
2005-06-25T06:07:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,cd /usr/src/linux-headers-2.6.10-5
2005-06-25T06:08:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,:ok
2005-06-25T06:08:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,now sudo make-kpkg modules_image
2005-06-25T06:09:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,might take a little while. you should see lots of exciting commands and stuff
2005-06-25T06:10:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,that last line should be: 'Module /usr/src/modules/sl-modem processed fine'
2005-06-25T06:11:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"ok, now 'cd ..' and 'ls *.deb'"
2005-06-25T06:11:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,you should see a file 'sl-modem-modules-2.6.10.....deb' where ... probably depends on your precise kernel version
2005-06-25T06:12:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,ok
2005-06-25T06:12:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"i tried to install this file earlier and it broke, but i think we can force it"
2005-06-25T06:12:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,stand-by
2005-06-25T06:13:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,can you hang on one second?
2005-06-25T06:14:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,i think maybe one needs to be in 'linux-headers-2.6.10-5-386' not 'linux-headers-2.6.10-5'
2005-06-25T06:14:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,hmm
2005-06-25T06:14:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,what's the other one called?
2005-06-25T06:16:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"hmm, i think that one might be the better one to install"
2005-06-25T06:17:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"i don't know why i keep getting a 'Custm.deb', but nevermind"
2005-06-25T06:17:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,'sudo dpkg -i <that-file>'
2005-06-25T06:17:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,err
2005-06-25T06:18:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"well, let's try it anyway"
2005-06-25T06:19:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,": creating /dev/modem symlink, pointing to /dev/ttySL0"
2005-06-25T06:19:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,excellent
2005-06-25T06:19:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: I ahd this already many times
2005-06-25T06:19:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,oh
2005-06-25T06:19:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,so not so excellent
2005-06-25T06:20:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,does lsmod|grep sl-modem show anything
2005-06-25T06:20:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"yeah, we can check that in a moment"
2005-06-25T06:20:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"you've installed it, right? sl-modem-daemon?"
2005-06-25T06:22:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,": lsmod|grep sl-modem does nothing, what was it for ?"
2005-06-25T06:22:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,lsmod lists loaded kernel modules
2005-06-25T06:23:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"| is a 'pipe' , and grep is a text search utility"
2005-06-25T06:23:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,don't despair yet
2005-06-25T06:23:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"you don't remember what the command you gave to build the non-custom deb was, by any chance?"
2005-06-25T06:24:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: you mean the custom one ?
2005-06-25T06:25:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,": maybe we would spend more time to re-do all from the begining, now that I can type the command it shouldn't be too long ?"
2005-06-25T06:25:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,i think everything is ok
2005-06-25T06:25:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,we probably just need to start the daemon and load the module
2005-06-25T06:28:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,and what did it say?
2005-06-25T06:28:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: to install the daemon I did dpkg -i sl-modem-daemon....deb
2005-06-25T06:29:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"right, but when you did /etc/init.d/slmodemd (or whatever) what did it say?"
2005-06-25T06:30:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,the command?
2005-06-25T06:30:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,try 'sudo /etc/init.d/sl-modem-daemon restart'
2005-06-25T06:31:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,i'm not sure of the precise command name -- you can use tab completion
2005-06-25T06:31:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,otherwise maybe 'sudo invoke-rc.d sl-modem-daemon restart'
2005-06-25T06:31:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,i believe those two commands are equivalent
2005-06-25T06:32:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: look at this : https://wiki.ubuntu.com//BinaryDriverHowto at the end of the page
2005-06-25T06:32:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,": his driver seems rather finicky. Basically, if it works, a file called /dev/ttySL0 will exist. If it doesn't work, running sudo /etc/init.d/sl-modem-daemon restart may help, as might running modprobe slamr, but it seems somewhat random. A reboot may help too."
2005-06-25T06:33:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,ah-ha
2005-06-25T06:34:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,yes ?
2005-06-25T06:34:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,is this how you got that .deb ? the one that wasn't custom?
2005-06-25T06:34:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,ok
2005-06-25T06:34:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"standby, let me run this quick. I wonder how i did it before *puzzlement*"
2005-06-25T06:36:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: sudo /etc/init.d/sl-modem-daemon restart tells :
2005-06-25T06:36:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,hrm. i think that might be for warty - the 'Depends' field is already updated
2005-06-25T06:37:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"i guessed the module name wrong earlier, btw"
2005-06-25T06:37:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,try 'lsmod|grep slamr'
2005-06-25T06:37:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,": shutting down samrtlink modem driver normmallu, loading ALSA modem driver into kernel... done. Starting smartlnk modem driver for : hw:0. creating /dev/modem smylink, pointing to /dev/ttySL0."
2005-06-25T06:38:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,and ls -l /dev/modem shows?
2005-06-25T06:38:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: slamr 376004 0
2005-06-25T06:38:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,good stuff

2005-06-25T06:39:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"ok, it looks like it might be working"
2005-06-25T06:40:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"well, let's see if we can test it"
2005-06-25T06:40:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,try in your home directory typing 'wvdialconf wvdial.conf' and see what happens
2005-06-25T06:40:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"you might need to sudo that, but try it without first"
2005-06-25T06:41:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: I don't need sudo
2005-06-25T06:41:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: it writes a lot of stuff
2005-06-25T06:42:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,does it look like good or bad news?
2005-06-25T06:42:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: everything seems to be OK
2005-06-25T06:42:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,yay
2005-06-25T06:42:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: as it is written on each end line
2005-06-25T06:42:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: and at the end : 'found a modem on /dev/ttySL0'
2005-06-25T06:43:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"ok, that sounds promising"
2005-06-25T06:43:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: ok so looks like it was the good driver for the modem right ?
2005-06-25T06:43:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"yeah, looks like it's a go"
2005-06-25T06:43:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"you need to setup ppp now (i.e., dial-up settings)"
2005-06-25T06:43:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: ok so now I go to SSYTEM->ADMINISTRATION->NETWORK
2005-06-25T06:44:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"try first the gnome ppp thing. yeah, there exactly"
2005-06-25T06:44:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,:: I wrote the parameters already
2005-06-25T06:44:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,at some point you'll need a phone line to test this with ;)
2005-06-25T06:44:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,ok
2005-06-25T06:46:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,the phone line might have to be plugged in
2005-06-25T06:46:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: proprieties -> modem-> auto-detect ok ?
2005-06-25T06:46:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"and try pointing it to /dev/ttySL0 instead of /dev/modem, though that shouldn't matter"
2005-06-25T06:46:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"ag, i wouldn't bother with that"
2005-06-25T06:46:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,just tell it to use /dev/modem
2005-06-25T06:46:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: ok wait
2005-06-25T06:47:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: nw the phone line isn't on my laptop... in order to talk to you
2005-06-25T06:47:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,": I'll try to detect the modem without, it normally should be okay"
2005-06-25T06:47:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,i figured as much ;)
2005-06-25T06:48:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,": ok, can I try to detect the port whitout type anything ?"
2005-06-25T06:48:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,let me see if i can access that dialog with shutting down my connection...
2005-06-25T06:49:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: ok in the same time I try on my side
2005-06-25T06:49:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,just type in /dev/modem for 'Modem port'
2005-06-25T06:49:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,don't use the autodetect button
2005-06-25T06:49:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,:
2005-06-25T06:49:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,and?
2005-06-25T06:50:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"ok, that's good"
2005-06-25T06:50:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,i couldn't get it to find my winmodem
2005-06-25T06:50:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"now setup the phone number, user/password options and try it out"
2005-06-25T06:50:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,": ok, now how can I test ?"
2005-06-25T06:50:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,only one way really ;) dial-up
2005-06-25T06:50:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: I've already done that; but how to connect ?
2005-06-25T06:51:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,go back to the first dialog box ('Network settings') and 'activate' the interface
2005-06-25T06:51:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,button just below properties
2005-06-25T06:51:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,there's also a gnome applet you can use
2005-06-25T06:52:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"well, if sl-modem-modules wasn't installed, it wouldn't work before"
2005-06-25T06:52:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: well... I have to disconnect ti test
2005-06-25T06:52:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,yip
2005-06-25T06:52:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,one moment
2005-06-25T06:53:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,you can look in /var/log/messages and /var/log/syslog for pppd messages
2005-06-25T06:53:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"might be useful if something goes wrong (e.g., wrong password or something)"
2005-06-25T06:53:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"otherwise, good luck"
2005-06-25T06:54:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,hopefully in ubuntu ;)
2005-06-25T06:58:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,success?
2005-06-25T07:01:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"hmm. the modem works under windows, right? and the line was properly plugged in?"
2005-06-25T07:02:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,hrm
2005-06-25T07:05:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,i'm stumped
2005-06-25T07:07:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"i really don't think it'll help, but you could try rebooting"
2005-06-25T07:08:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"also, regaring the 'click' -- you should hear it even if there's no line plugged in, so it's one way to check without disconnecting this pc"
2005-06-25T07:09:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: I hear nothing
2005-06-25T07:09:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: could it be another error
2005-06-25T07:09:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: another thing bad configured
2005-06-25T07:09:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"unfortunately, i'm not sure how to test this"
2005-06-25T07:09:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: cause now it detects the modem well..
2005-06-25T07:10:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"you have the kernel module loaded, and the daemon running, and yes, the modem is detected"
2005-06-25T07:11:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: the peripheric is ppp0 right ?
2005-06-25T07:12:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,the interface is called ppp0
2005-06-25T07:12:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: in the properties when I am in 'general' I have to check 'this peripheric is configured' right ? and fill the rest
2005-06-25T07:12:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"oh, right"
2005-06-25T07:12:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: so I am doing...
2005-06-25T07:13:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"yes, it's ppp0 in that dialog"
2005-06-25T07:13:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: phone number : I put it
2005-06-25T07:13:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: prefix : I don't know... I think there is no one
2005-06-25T07:13:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"the problem is more likely with the driver, since you have 'NO DIALTONE'"
2005-06-25T07:14:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,": user and pwd, I put it"
2005-06-25T07:14:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,these details are not yet testable
2005-06-25T07:14:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: ah you think ?
2005-06-25T07:14:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"yeah, you said you don't hear the 'click' (i presume you do hear such a click in windows?)"
2005-06-25T07:21:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,": ok, thats I was thinking too..."
2005-06-25T07:14:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"and pppd reports 'NO DIALTONE', so the problem is at a deeper level"
2005-06-25T07:15:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,does the computer still think the ppp interface is up?
2005-06-25T07:16:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: right under the 'connexion per modem' there is something
2005-06-25T07:17:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,ah-ha?
2005-06-25T07:17:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: yeah that's why I'm tring to translate it :-D
2005-06-25T07:18:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,that's for your network card -- does the laptop have a builtin network card?
2005-06-25T07:18:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,": ok, yes it has one"
2005-06-25T07:19:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: one that works well
2005-06-25T07:19:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,that's what thats for
2005-06-25T07:19:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: but I didn't told you all
2005-06-25T07:19:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,ok...
2005-06-25T07:19:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,": during installation, the configuration of the network failed"
2005-06-25T07:20:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: could it be important ?
2005-06-25T07:20:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,i doubt it
2005-06-25T07:21:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"your network card wasn't plugged in at the time, was it?"
2005-06-25T07:21:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: yes it was
2005-06-25T07:22:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: it begins to be boring :)
2005-06-25T07:23:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: I think we'll never succed
2005-06-25T07:23:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"well, i'm out of ideas, i'm afraid"
2005-06-25T07:23:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,one very last thing you could try doing is rebooting
2005-06-25T07:23:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,and trying again
2005-06-25T07:24:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: yes I'll do that
2005-06-25T07:24:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,but that's clutching at straws
2005-06-25T07:24:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,": you know what, I'll soon have another modem !!!"
2005-06-25T07:24:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,ah-ha?
2005-06-25T07:24:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,what sort?
2005-06-25T07:24:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"ah, i'm jealous!"
2005-06-25T07:25:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,": yes, 8Mb"
2005-06-25T07:25:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,nice
2005-06-25T07:25:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,hopefully that'll work with ubuntu
2005-06-25T07:26:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: a friend of mine told me it was even harder to install
2005-06-25T07:26:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,:: oh you think ?
2005-06-25T07:26:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"i don't know, i've never done it"
2005-06-25T07:26:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: :)
2005-06-25T07:26:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: I'm looking for what kind of modem it is
2005-06-25T07:28:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: tis is it : http://support.free.fr/maj/freebox_V3-V4_ppp.pdf
2005-06-25T07:29:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,there's not much on dsl on the wiki... hmm
2005-06-25T07:30:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,:/ :)
2005-06-25T07:33:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,i'm sure there are people here using DSL with ubuntu
2005-06-25T07:33:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"when you get the modem, maybe you can ask more"
2005-06-25T07:33:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: yeah sure...
2005-06-25T07:35:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: I just reboot.. does not work ... :/
2005-06-25T07:35:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"ok. sorry, i'm out of ideas"
2005-06-25T07:35:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: forget it.... it was nice I learnt many things ;)
2005-06-25T07:36:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,ok
2005-06-25T07:36:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,at least you got past the brown screen of death
2005-06-25T07:36:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,": since I'll have my other modem/connexion soon, it is not so hard to stay with windows..."
2005-06-25T07:36:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: yeah !
2005-06-25T07:36:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: but i comparaison this was a easy pb
2005-06-25T07:38:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,": but I'm sure i'll have many many probelms in the future... configuring things like usb devices, and NETWORK"
2005-06-25T07:38:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,heh
2005-06-25T07:39:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"ethernet devices are usually ok. wireless can be a pain, from what i've seen here"
2005-06-25T07:39:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,and usb is also usually ok
2005-06-25T07:39:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"depending on what sort of device it is, anyway"
2005-06-25T07:39:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: you probably understand that I don't believe someone who's telling me that one thing is usally ok ;)
2005-06-25T07:40:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,heh
2005-06-25T07:40:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,only real problem i've had is with my winmodem
2005-06-25T07:40:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,": since with my case, there are always pbs :-D"
2005-06-25T07:40:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,my usb memory stick and bluetooth dongle work out of the box
2005-06-25T07:40:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: you have a Mac ?
2005-06-25T07:41:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,nope. never even seen one
2005-06-25T07:41:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: lol okay
2005-06-25T07:50:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: just one or two more things
2005-06-25T07:50:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: if you have time
2005-06-25T07:50:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,sure
2005-06-25T07:50:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,": in your network panel, in properties"
2005-06-25T07:51:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,ok
2005-06-25T07:51:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,first line is 'ff00::0'    'ip6-mcastprefix'
2005-06-25T07:52:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: ok me too... so it can not be this :)
2005-06-25T07:53:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,that's at a much higher level than the modem driver
2005-06-25T07:53:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: are sure that this was the correct driver ?
2005-06-25T07:54:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: I mean the driver works okay but....
2005-06-25T07:54:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"no, i'm not. if scanModem said you have smart-link, i'd go with that"
2005-06-25T07:54:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"but it might be wrong, i don't know"
2005-06-25T07:54:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,what is the driver called in windows? do you know?
2005-06-25T07:54:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: no but I'll look
2005-06-25T07:58:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,": I tried to open synaptic to install te emacs package, but it's telling me that my system has a broken package"
2005-06-25T08:00:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,": I check the emacs case, to install it, and finally it is tellng me that I'll have to install many packages with emacs"
2005-06-25T08:00:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,hmm
2005-06-25T08:00:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,i got something similar
2005-06-25T08:00:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,there's something funny with the dependencies in that deb file
2005-06-25T08:01:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,it's part of that whole 'Custom' thing I couldn't figure out
2005-06-25T08:01:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: I'm glad if you find this is funny ;)
2005-06-25T08:01:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,not at all
2005-06-25T08:01:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,it's confusing
2005-06-25T08:01:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: :-)
2005-06-25T08:01:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"i installed these sl-modem drivers before, and didn't have these problems"
2005-06-25T08:03:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,": well, I have done nothing on my linux for the moment, except finding the acpi pb... do you think that re-install ubuntu woudl change something ?"
2005-06-25T08:03:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,you mean fix anything? i doubt it
2005-06-25T08:05:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,i don't know
2005-06-25T08:05:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: I don't care after all... I do it :)
2005-06-25T08:05:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"it isn't working anyway, so if you want emacs, you might as well uninstall it"
2005-06-25T08:08:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"build-essential is gcc (C compiler), g++ (C++) and make (a build tool)"
2005-06-25T08:08:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,dpkg-dev i'm not sure of -- probably for building .deb files
2005-06-25T08:08:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: you're telling me that gcc wasn't installed ?????
2005-06-25T08:09:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,and finally linux-headers is the /usr/src/linux-headers-* directories -- includes configuration info for your current install
2005-06-25T08:09:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,not by default. most people don't need gcc ;)
2005-06-25T08:09:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,:argh
2005-06-25T08:09:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"believe it or not, ubuntu usually works without users needing to compile anything ;)"
2005-06-25T08:09:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,": my fisrt use of my computer is internet, my second is programmation !!"
2005-06-25T08:09:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"well, it is right there on the cd"
2005-06-25T08:10:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,it's not like you can't easily get it ;)
2005-06-25T08:10:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: and to update.. is it easy ?
2005-06-25T08:11:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"yes, just use synaptic"
2005-06-25T08:11:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"you need to tell synaptic to look on the internet for updates, but that's about it"
2005-06-25T08:11:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"every day or so just 'Reload' and 'Apply' in synaptic, and you'll be up to date"
2005-06-25T08:12:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: oh.. yesterday your mount command was not corretct
2005-06-25T08:12:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,oh?
2005-06-25T08:13:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"hmm. i tested it here on my fat16 memory stick, and it worked"
2005-06-25T08:18:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,": sudo mount -t vfat /dev/hda5 /media/share -o umask=222,ro works"
2005-06-25T08:46:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"i'll try the latest version.. why, you having problems?"
2005-06-25T08:46:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: did you try to decompress the scanmodem file ? :-[
2005-06-25T08:47:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: I mean this one : http://linmodems.technion.ac.il/packages/scanModem.gz
2005-06-25T08:47:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,yip
2005-06-25T08:47:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,use gunzip to decompress it
2005-06-25T08:48:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,just downloaded and gunzipped it -- seems to be OK
2005-06-25T08:48:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,try 'file scanModem.gz' -- maybe your browser decompressed it
2005-06-25T08:48:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,erk
2005-06-25T08:48:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,put it in your home directory
2005-06-25T08:49:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: gods are against me
2005-06-25T08:49:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,ls -l scanModem.gz ?
2005-06-25T08:49:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: it is already in my home
2005-06-25T08:49:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,how did you get it onto your laptop?
2005-06-25T08:49:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,maybe it belongs to root still
2005-06-25T08:49:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,sudo chown heimdall scanModem.gz   to change ownership
2005-06-25T08:50:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,": I dowloaded it from another computer, then brought it on a floppy to my fat32 partition under win, and then cp it in my home directory under linux"
2005-06-25T08:50:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,ls -l scanModem.gz to see who owns the file
2005-06-25T08:51:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,": lol, too strange, I have no rights on this file ..."
2005-06-25T08:51:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,sudo chown heimdall scanModem.gz    to change ownership

2005-06-25T08:54:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,that will tell you what sort of file it (probably) is
2005-06-25T08:54:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,it's possible your browser already decompressed it
2005-06-25T08:54:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,how big is the file ?
2005-06-25T08:54:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,uncompressed it should be 189906 bytes
2005-06-25T08:54:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: yes youre right

2005-06-25T08:57:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,try to read through it and see if you can find what kind of modem it thinks you have
2005-06-25T08:57:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"it should have created directory, called maybe 'Modem' or something like that, with informational files in"

2005-06-25T09:40:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"ok, going there now"
2005-06-25T09:40:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,": I don't understand very much of those files BUT, I found something"
2005-06-25T09:41:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,": this link : http://linmodems.technion.ac.il/slmodem-serial.html, which actually talk about the new driver"
2005-06-25T09:41:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,": it could be that the previous driver was not ok, so I uninstalled all, and I wanna try this new one"
2005-06-25T09:44:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,hrm
2005-06-25T09:44:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,yes ?
2005-06-25T09:45:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,have you tried that 'the symptom' part? Do you have that problem?
2005-06-25T09:45:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,i thought your modemd launch ok
2005-06-25T09:45:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: what symptom aprt ?
2005-06-25T09:46:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,near the top of http://linmodems.technion.ac.il/slmodem-serial.html
2005-06-25T09:46:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,'The symptom:'
2005-06-25T09:46:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: err...no :-D
2005-06-25T09:47:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,": I'll install the new driver, can't be worst"
2005-06-25T09:47:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,fair enough
2005-06-25T09:48:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,is that for me?
2005-06-25T09:49:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,": sorry, yes"
2005-06-25T09:49:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: is that correct ?
2005-06-25T09:49:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,that should work if the directory /media/floppy exists
2005-06-25T09:49:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,you might want a 'umask=222' or similar option
2005-06-25T09:49:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,does /media/floppy exist ?
2005-06-25T09:50:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,try 'mount /dev/fd0'
2005-06-25T09:50:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,yes ;)
2005-06-25T09:50:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"/dev/fd0 is in /etc/fstab with a 'user' option, so you shouldn't need sudo"
2005-06-25T09:51:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,which version of the driver are you going to try?
2005-06-25T09:51:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: http://www.smlink.com/objects/slmodem-2.9.10.tar.gz
2005-06-25T09:52:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: I've read about : http://linmodems.technion.ac.il/packages/smartlink/ungrab-winmodem.tar.gz also in the files...
2005-06-25T09:53:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"that's only needed in specific cases, as far as i can tell from the linmodems page"
2005-06-25T09:53:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: well tat cool I'm learning a lot of things
2005-06-25T09:54:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,it might be worth trying if what you're doing now doesn't work
2005-06-25T09:54:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,bear in mind this will all be for naught when you get your adsl modem
2005-06-25T09:57:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,": ok have decompressed the driver with gzip, now what ? this is not a deb file"
2005-06-25T09:57:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,indeed
2005-06-25T09:58:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,just a sec
2005-06-25T09:58:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,how big is the download?
2005-06-25T09:59:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"ok, i'm downloading it now"
2005-06-25T09:59:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,does it have a readme?
2005-06-25T10:00:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,try 'tar xf slmodem-2.9.10.tar
2005-06-25T10:00:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,you can extract directly from tar.gz's with 'tar xzf slmodem-2.9.10.tar.gz
2005-06-25T10:01:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"it should create an sl-modem directory, or perhaps sl-modem-2.9.10 directory"
2005-06-25T10:02:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,ah-ha
2005-06-25T10:02:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: seems to be much easier
2005-06-25T10:02:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,sort of
2005-06-25T10:03:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,you'll need to recompile the driver every time you update the kernel
2005-06-25T10:03:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,try just running 'make' and 'sudo make install' as suggested in the README
2005-06-25T10:04:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"yeah, the instructions are pretty clear"
2005-06-25T10:05:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: ok I've made it
2005-06-25T10:05:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,'sudo make install' etc -- follow the instructions in the README
2005-06-25T10:06:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: yes I'm at config country
2005-06-25T10:07:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,is it working?
2005-06-25T10:08:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,which command?
2005-06-25T10:09:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,or just don't worry about it for now
2005-06-25T10:29:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,use /dev/ttySL0
2005-06-25T10:10:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: so this is it
2005-06-25T10:10:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,do the 'Getting started' instructions too
2005-06-25T10:10:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,afaik
2005-06-25T10:11:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,you can probably tweak things so these commands are run on startup
2005-06-25T10:16:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,:oooooh he does not want france :)
2005-06-25T10:16:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,i'm sorry? ;)
2005-06-25T10:17:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,you need a code i think
2005-06-25T10:18:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,try slmodemd --countrylist
2005-06-25T10:18:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,try slmodemd --country=3d mayne?
2005-06-25T10:19:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,so this is more-or-less working?
2005-06-25T10:19:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"slmodemd, i think"
2005-06-25T10:20:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,nah
2005-06-25T10:21:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"so modprobe worked, and slmodemd is running?"
2005-06-25T10:22:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"ok, so try out your gnome network thingy again"
2005-06-25T10:22:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"maybe you can just start it and see if there's a 'click' sound, without plugging in the telephone cord"
2005-06-25T10:23:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,this is it
2005-06-25T10:24:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,:I have very bad thought
2005-06-25T10:25:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,what's that?
2005-06-25T10:25:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,": well ,with the previous driver, it was telling me too that the device was ttySL0"
2005-06-25T10:26:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,yes...
2005-06-25T10:26:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,doh
2005-06-25T10:26:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,that might explain the 'no carrier' ;)
2005-06-25T10:26:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,i thought you were using /dev/modem ?
2005-06-25T10:27:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: ah yes you're right
2005-06-25T10:28:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,:can I type ttySL0 ?
2005-06-25T10:28:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"you mean, in the gnome setup?"
2005-06-25T10:28:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,/dev/ttySL0 should work
2005-06-25T10:29:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,whatever slmodemd said when you started it
2005-06-25T10:29:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,don't use /dev/pts/2
2005-06-25T10:30:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: aaaaaah
2005-06-25T10:30:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,something wirking ?
2005-06-25T10:31:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: good news
2005-06-25T10:31:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: no
2005-06-25T10:31:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,heh
2005-06-25T10:31:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"erm, ok"
2005-06-25T10:31:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,you going to try plugging in your phone line and see what happens?
2005-06-25T10:32:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,ok
2005-06-25T10:32:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,good luck (again ;)
2005-06-25T10:49:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: :'(
2005-06-25T10:57:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,success?
2005-06-25T11:06:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,": sorry, phone"
2005-06-25T11:07:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,": and worst, i have uninstall, make clean, and do ti again"
2005-06-25T11:07:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: but it does not want to do 'modprobe slamr' anymore
2005-06-25T11:08:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,hmm
2005-06-26T06:30:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,how are you creating the account? smdpasswd ?
2005-06-26T06:31:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"also, must be 'sudo'"
2005-06-26T06:31:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,what error do you get?
2005-06-26T06:32:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,good afternoon ;)
2005-06-26T06:32:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,hmm
2005-06-26T06:33:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: I keep having strange things ;)
2005-06-26T06:33:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,do you perhaps have 'unix password sync = yes'  in smb.conf ?
2005-06-26T06:34:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,i don't think that it's set to 'yes' by default
2005-06-26T06:34:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,have you tweaked smb.conf at all?
2005-06-26T06:35:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: no never
2005-06-26T06:35:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,in /etc/samba
2005-06-26T06:36:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,hmm. i think that that file is just a sample
2005-06-26T06:36:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: that's a no
2005-06-26T06:36:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"err, what's a no?"
2005-06-26T06:37:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,ok
2005-06-26T06:39:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: http://forums.suselinuxsupport.de/lofiversion/index.php/t10725.html
2005-06-26T06:39:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,could you put /etc/samba/smb.conf up on http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl ?
2005-06-26T06:39:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"aargh. i did a test of smbpasswd, but the user i added exists on my system"
2005-06-26T06:40:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,i'm sure there must be a way to add an smb user without having a local user account
2005-06-26T06:40:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: I believe you
2005-06-26T06:42:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: http://nico.aunai.free.fr/tmp/SMB.CON
2005-06-26T06:44:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,hrm. a quick browse of smb.conf doesn't reveal how to have 'smb only' users
2005-06-26T06:44:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,easy option is to add the user to your system before running smbpasswd
2005-06-26T06:45:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,add a user either with adduser (command line) or System -> Administration -> Users and Groups
2005-06-26T06:46:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: but it is not said that I have to add user to my system before
2005-06-26T06:46:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,it's news to me too
2005-06-26T06:46:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: on the ubuntu website it is not said too
2005-06-26T06:47:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"however, if you read 'man smbpasswd', you'll find this: 'the default passdb backends require the user to already exist in the system password file (usually /etc/passwd)'"
2005-06-26T06:47:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,possibly the wiki page is incorrect
2005-06-26T06:47:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,what's the URL ?
2005-06-26T06:47:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"add a comment to the bottom regarding this, if you like"
2005-06-26T06:48:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,": http://wiki.ubuntu-fr.org/applications/samba it has to be some equivalent in english, removing the '-fr' and putting '.com' instead of '.org'"
2005-06-26T06:48:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,you will need an ubuntulinux.org account; shouldn't take long to create one
2005-06-26T06:48:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,"oh, cool :)"
2005-06-26T06:49:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"oh, i don't know ubuntu-fr.org -- the english one is here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SettingUpSamba (i think)"
2005-06-26T06:50:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: you see... now I'm trying to configure the network :)
2005-06-26T06:50:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,good stuff
2005-06-26T06:50:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: it is much easier
2005-06-26T06:50:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,just to check -- you never got your modem working?
2005-06-26T06:50:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: it already works
2005-06-26T06:50:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: no... :)
2005-06-26T06:50:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,ok
2005-06-26T06:51:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,you have connected your laptop and other computer ?
2005-06-26T06:51:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: don't care... my other one will be here soon ;)
2005-06-26T06:51:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,": yes, but the other is under winXP"
2005-06-26T06:52:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: this is the one with which I can be here :)
2005-06-26T06:52:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"cool. you *should* be able to enable 'internet sharing' or something under win xp, to get your laptop online"
2005-06-26T06:52:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,but i'm not sure how that works
2005-06-26T06:53:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,": apparently the netwok work, but I have to create a samba account to access to my laptop from XP"
2005-06-26T06:53:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,yeah
2005-06-26T06:53:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"can't you use your 'normal' account -- 'heimdall', or whatever it might be?"
2005-06-26T06:53:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,": I never been able to do it with two win, so imagine to share my connection with my ubuntu :-D"
2005-06-26T06:53:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: hum... it does not look very secure
2005-06-26T06:54:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"then create another user on your laptop, and use smbpasswd on that account"
2005-06-26T06:54:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,you can always disable logins for the extra account
2005-06-26T06:54:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: it is done :)
2005-06-26T06:55:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: it is working well :)
2005-06-26T06:55:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,good stuff
2005-06-26T06:56:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: yeaaah :) in fact I'm configuring network because my next modem will be plugged on my RJ45 port
2005-06-26T06:58:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: do you know how toa ccess to the network in the cmmand line way ?
2005-06-26T07:01:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,you mean accessing shares ?
2005-06-26T07:01:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,smbclient on linux
2005-06-26T07:01:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,like this: smbclient //windowsmachine/sharename -U username
2005-06-26T07:02:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,for nautilus and firefox you can use smb://windowsmachinename/sharename
2005-06-26T07:02:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,not sure if i've answered your question
2005-06-26T07:06:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,": ok I have put my ubuntu in english it will be easier to comunicate..., well I wanna do in console mode what I can do from 'places->network servers'"
2005-06-26T07:06:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,smbclient is a useful tool for this
2005-06-26T07:06:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,try also 'smbtree'
2005-06-26T07:06:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"e.g., to list shares on a computer, try 'smbclient -L windowsmachine'"
2005-06-26T07:07:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: smbtree do that too :)
2005-06-26T07:07:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,to be honest i've never used smbtree
2005-06-26T11:01:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: oh you're back :)
2005-06-26T11:01:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: don't worry I have no questions :) :-p

2005-07-08T05:10:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,excellent. was it easy to setup?
2005-07-08T05:10:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,just to plug it ! it is an ethernet connection
2005-07-08T05:11:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"ah, ok"
2005-07-08T05:11:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool, 15 days and I have 8Mb ! ;)

2005-07-14T13:17:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,": yep, 4Mb now...."
2005-07-14T13:17:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: little pb should be 8 :)
2005-07-14T13:17:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,nice ;)
2005-07-14T13:18:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: not so nice I can't use it
2005-07-14T13:18:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,i meant the 4Mb :P
2005-07-14T13:18:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: yes but 4Mb too I can't use it
2005-07-14T13:19:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,": i've made a mistake, are you familiar with grub ?"
2005-07-14T13:20:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"err, not very, but I know a little bit"
2005-07-14T13:21:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: probably more than me anyway.... I've renamed the menu.lst file :-D
2005-07-14T13:21:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: so now I can't boot anymore
2005-07-14T13:23:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,do you have the live cd?
2005-07-14T13:23:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,or even the install cd?
2005-07-14T13:23:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: no
2005-07-14T13:23:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: install cd yes
2005-07-14T13:23:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"um. ok, i *think* you can get to a terminal with the install cd"
2005-07-14T13:24:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: oh ?
2005-07-14T13:25:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"boot the install cd, start the boot (don't actually install !) and press Alt-F2 to get to a different terminal"
2005-07-14T13:25:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: what do you mean by 'start the boot' without installing something ?
2005-07-14T13:26:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"well, you need to boot linux, so you'll need to choose a 'boot option'"
2005-07-14T13:26:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,on the cd
2005-07-14T13:26:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,it won't actually install immediately
2005-07-14T13:29:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: there is no way to boot something without starting an installation process
2005-07-14T13:30:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,it'll first ask for partitioning etc info
2005-07-14T13:30:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,it won't install right away
2005-07-14T13:30:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: maybe I can type the correct command on the gub prompt
2005-07-14T13:31:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"no, you can't do filename manipulation from grub"
2005-07-14T13:31:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: yes but I can boot no ?
2005-07-14T13:31:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: kernel /boot/vmlinuz etc....
2005-07-14T13:31:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,ah
2005-07-14T13:31:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"yeah, i guess"
2005-07-14T13:32:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,could you past me your command to see what it looks like ?
2005-07-14T13:32:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"ok, stand by"
2005-07-14T13:32:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"ok, there are three commands"
2005-07-14T13:33:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,ok. you know what your root partition etc is?
2005-07-14T13:34:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"i remember you had acpi stuff, yeah"
2005-07-14T13:34:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,i think you can just tack that on the end
2005-07-14T13:35:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,"well for two days now, the acpi stuff does not work, thats the reason I changed the menu.lst file"
2005-07-14T13:36:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,hmm
2005-07-14T13:36:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,what changes?
2005-07-14T13:37:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: I don't know it seems pci=noacpi was removed
2005-07-14T13:37:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,oh
2005-07-14T13:37:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: since I had the same mistake I had before
2005-07-14T13:37:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"yes, you need to add it higher up in menu.lst, so that it is included every time there's a kernel update"
2005-07-14T13:38:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,what .?
2005-07-14T13:38:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,let me know when you've booted and I'll tell you where (kopt= line near the top)
2005-07-14T13:39:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"you may need a      'root         (hd0,2)'   line as well, i'm not sure"
2005-07-14T13:40:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: wow good it seems to work ... it is booting
2005-07-14T13:41:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,: good news I'm under gnome !
2005-07-14T13:42:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,good stuff
2005-07-14T13:42:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"ok, rename menu.lst first ;)"
2005-07-14T13:42:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"and near the top, you should see a line like this '#kopt=root=/dev/hda3 ro"
2005-07-14T13:42:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,add your vga=777 pci=noapci line to that
2005-07-21T16:28:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,tetex ?
2005-07-21T16:30:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"there are some others, whose names escape me"
2005-07-21T16:30:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,i think there's also 'tth'
2005-07-21T16:47:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,i'd recommend generating pdf instead -- most people can read it
2005-07-21T16:48:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,yeah I'm making pdf too...
2005-07-21T16:48:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,but I thought html version could be nice too
2005-07-21T16:49:00.000Z,HappyFool,Heimdall,"fair enough. i'd worry less about that, and get on with writing the article/thesis whatever ;)"
2005-07-21T16:49:00.000Z,Heimdall,HappyFool,yeah you're rigth :)
