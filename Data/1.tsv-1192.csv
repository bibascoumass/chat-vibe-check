2007-09-28T10:24:00.000Z,Evanlec,,oh lord can someone please help me...my drive has become locked 'read-only' after enabling the aname and writeback options on my root partition thru fstab
2007-09-28T10:25:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,dont enable those options?
2007-10-09T09:43:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,gentoo
2007-10-09T09:47:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,i was just about to look into that
2007-10-09T10:03:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,im installing it right now
2007-10-09T10:03:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,but will u be able to benchmark it?
2007-10-09T10:04:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,i suppose i could
2007-10-09T10:04:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,well otherwise your results would be rather subjective dont u think?
2007-10-09T10:05:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"i suppose, but i like to think that it would run better with a low latency kernel, it would only make sense i suppose"
2007-10-09T10:06:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"i dont necessarily understand what a low-latency kernel does, and why default kernels aren't 'low-latency' to begin with"
2007-10-09T10:06:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,what would i use to benchmark? ive never really done it before
2007-10-09T10:07:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"not sure lol, theres one called LMbench"
2007-10-09T10:21:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,u using feisty or gutsy?
2007-10-09T10:22:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"probably not, apparently the mirrors have packages that will break your system, i havent upgraded in a couple days"
2007-10-09T10:22:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"yea, well i wasnt going to dist-upgrade, was just gonna get new kernel...but maybe thats a no no without upgrading distro"
2007-10-09T10:23:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"it can become complicated, but its possible"
2007-10-09T10:24:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"i always recommend a clean install, but ill prolly upgrade myself lol"
2007-10-09T10:25:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"heh yea....i dunno, im iffy about how to backup my /home folder and restore it on the new install...."
2007-10-09T10:25:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"im going to kill my xserver and try out those benchmarks, ill be back in a bit with a report :)"
2007-10-09T10:25:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,plus i wanted to setup raid/lvm but frostburn tells me raid0 isnt worth the speed increase it gives
2007-10-09T10:25:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"sweet, i couldnt figure out how to run them from the man page but yea do that ;p"
2007-10-09T10:26:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"i konw nothing about raid0 lol, back in a flash..."
2007-10-10T09:18:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"ext3 journals, ext2 doesnt"
2007-10-10T09:18:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"right i know, but journaling isnt related to fragmentation correct?"
2007-10-10T09:19:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"hey by the way, did u ever test out that RT kernel last night?"
2007-10-10T09:19:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"it wouldnt boot, i was gonna compile one but i got lazy"
2007-10-10T09:20:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,wouldn't boot? thats not good...it should be the same as the gutsy kernel just with the rt patch...
2007-10-10T09:21:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"yea, it was -13 tho, and i heard that was giving some people problems, im using -12 right now"
2007-10-10T09:21:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,oh....well i hope i get a chance to try it out when i upgrade to gutsy
2007-10-10T08:47:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,that loads modules right away when u choose your kernel so things like mounting your root partition work before modules for it would be loaded
2007-10-10T08:47:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"i see, isnt it possible to not use initrd?"
2007-10-10T08:48:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,is there any implicit advantage in doing that?
2007-10-10T08:49:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"just to not have to make an initrd, i generally try to do that because its just one last step you have to do when compiling a kernel"
2007-10-10T08:49:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,you try to avoid making an initrd?
2007-10-10T08:49:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"yes, as much as possible"
2007-10-10T08:50:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"I used to compile kernels way back on redhat 7 i believe, am interested in doing it here on ubuntu, not because im a developer by any means, but just wanted to tweak and make a lean & fast kernel"
2007-10-10T08:52:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,just use a config from /boot and make sure to do a 'make oldconfig' first
2007-10-10T08:52:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,are you compiling a Ubuntu kernel or a stock kernel from kernel.org
2007-10-10T08:53:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,a vanilla kernel from kernel.org
2007-10-10T08:53:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,im guessing the vanilla kernel is a lot leaner than the ubuntu one
2007-10-10T08:54:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,is there any pitfalls i should watch out for when trying to do this myself?
2007-10-10T08:55:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"you shouldnt have any problems, just dont overwrite your other kernel images and boot options for them"
2007-10-10T08:55:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"right, well it has a lot of added hardware support, being those modules rite?"
2007-10-10T08:56:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"yes, its compiled for almost all kinds of hardware, obviously you dont have a need for all of them, but they are mostly modules, its not that the actual kernel image is bloated"
2007-10-10T08:56:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,oh i see
2007-10-10T08:57:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,do you have a link to a howto for compiling a linux kernel source ?
2007-10-10T08:58:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,i think so lemme check...
2007-10-10T09:00:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"i dont really have a link for it i guess, i just kinda know how to do it lol"
2007-10-10T09:13:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,im compiling it now :)
2007-10-10T09:15:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,compiling 2.6.23 vanilla?
2007-10-10T09:17:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,so far im planning to put in the latest nvidia driver and the RT2500 driver (my wifi card)
2007-10-10T09:29:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,how long on the kernel compile you estimate?
2007-10-10T09:30:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"forever prolly lol, i didnt uncheck most of the modules, so its compiling almost all of them, but i wanna get a kernel running before i start trimming it down"
2007-10-10T09:30:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"Oh, i heard 3-4 hours was average...lol"
2007-10-10T09:31:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"i doubt 3-4 hrs, im running dualcore turion64's it shouldnt take THAT long lol"
2007-10-10T09:31:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,lol yeah...im runnin a pentiumD @ 3.4ghz
2007-10-10T10:04:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,damn 1569 modules lol
2007-10-11T09:50:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,how goes it
2007-10-11T09:51:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,really...so what does that mean? you didnt compile the right headers for your hard drive controler?
2007-10-11T09:52:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,apparently not...im workin on it
2007-10-11T09:52:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,u using SATA?
2007-10-11T09:52:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,u compiled in the SATA support right? ;p
2007-10-11T09:52:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,i have to sata driver (sata_nv) built in
2007-10-11T09:53:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"okay just makin sure, figured u probly thot of that ;p"
2007-10-11T09:57:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,u ever had any luck getting extra buttons working on a mouse in ubuntu?
2007-10-11T09:58:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,extra buttons as far as what? side buttons?
2007-10-11T09:58:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,yes
2007-10-11T09:58:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"i used to i think in gentoo, but i dont remember how to do it"
2007-10-11T09:59:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"it seems to be a reall pain in the ass, i tried for a while but gave up"
2007-10-11T09:59:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,thats only if he has a processor that supports cpu scaling...
2007-10-11T10:02:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"lol i actually booted Vista today, wouldnt load my wireless card driver, searched on the manufacturer website, it said vista should work with no additonal drivers...i said okay well thats enough vista for 3 weeks, back to ubuntu ;p"
2007-10-11T10:03:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"it does startup a hell of a lot faster than XP, otherwise not much improvement really"
2007-10-11T10:24:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,ever tried to use a prefetching type app in ubuntu?
2007-10-11T10:24:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,not really
2007-10-11T10:25:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"ts a good idea, but seems not to be very well developed"
2007-10-11T10:27:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"right, and also preloading programs at boot-time"
2007-10-11T10:27:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,i would love that for firefox lol
2007-10-11T10:28:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,exactly what i was thinking
2007-10-11T10:28:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,i defiitely use firefox the most of any app
2007-10-11T10:28:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"yep, tho xchat starts pretty damn quick anyway"
2007-10-11T10:29:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"my wine takes like 5-10 minutes to start every time, its a pain in the arse, i forget all about trying to start a wine program before it opens lol"
2007-10-11T10:30:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"wine is always slow, i think thats cuz its wine..."
2007-10-11T10:30:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,but never this slow
2007-10-11T10:31:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"im gonna try it out, you might also: 'sudo apt-get install preload'"
2007-10-11T10:38:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"so what do u think? seems pretty straightforward, but not much documentation for it..."
2007-10-11T10:38:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,what do i do? just run it?
2007-10-11T10:38:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"itsa a daemon,so after doing apt-get, u got 'preload started' output?"
2007-10-12T09:14:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,hi hi
2007-10-12T09:20:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"im gonna have to agree with massey on the gimp, find it irrtating coming from photoshop"
2007-10-12T09:24:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,kvm?
2007-10-12T09:25:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,is that a replacement for vmware ?
2007-10-12T09:26:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"qemu is the actual program, kvm is a kernel module that makes it run smoother"
2007-10-12T09:27:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,what would u recommend for running winxp?
2007-10-12T09:27:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,virtualbox
2007-10-12T09:28:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"sweet, i think im going to try that, running photoshop thru wine makes me want to throw things"
2007-10-12T09:28:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,i hear ya there haha
2007-10-12T09:30:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,ahh whats the package name for virtualbox
2007-10-12T09:31:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,isnt it virtualbox?
2007-10-12T09:32:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"is there a way to have vbox use an existing windows installation, like a 'thin' installation sorta"
2007-10-12T09:33:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"i think u can use a physical partition, it may mess with trying to boot that partition later tho"
2007-10-12T09:34:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"its easy to do, but not really smart"
2007-10-12T09:34:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,why noot?
2007-10-12T09:34:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"bqmassey when the vm loads it, its different hardware that windows sees, therefore it needs to load different drivers and such each time, and we all know how windows deals with change"
2007-10-12T09:35:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"yea that does sound like a nightmare, it could then screw up booting the actual windows partition?"
2007-10-12T09:41:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"no probably not, but if u have an xp disc, i can give u a key..."
2007-10-12T09:41:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,oh i can get hacked keys no problem lol
2007-10-12T09:49:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"i dunno either, they aggressively promote it, ever read the pclos magazine?"
2007-10-12T09:51:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"i read one issue, the first article was all this BS about how this guy gave PCLOS, Ubuntu and like Mandriva to a bunch of 'newbies' and they all said they liked pclos and ubuntu was too hard lol"
2007-10-12T10:04:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,thats most definitely wired ... 10/100
2007-10-12T09:31:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,howd it go?
2007-10-12T09:34:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,what do u do just curious
2007-10-12T09:34:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"nothing, im going to college :)"
2007-10-12T09:35:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,nice
2007-10-12T09:35:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,computer engineering...tough major
2007-10-12T09:35:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,ooh yea i bet
2007-10-12T09:40:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,ur runnin 64-bit?
2007-10-12T09:40:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,yep
2007-10-12T09:40:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,did u try the 32-bit first?
2007-10-12T09:40:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,ive used ubuntu since 4.10 (first release) so yea ive used 32 bit
2007-10-12T09:41:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,when/why did u decide to jump to 64?
2007-10-12T09:41:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,when i got a 64 bit processor :)
2007-10-12T09:41:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"lol...ive had one for a while, its an intel tho so its not displayed on the box everywhere"
2007-10-12T09:42:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"but ive heard varying opinions about 64-bit ubuntu, some say dont bother, others say how could u not?!?"
2007-10-12T09:42:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"its personal preference, why wouldnt you though, get the most out of the hardware i guess"
2007-10-12T09:43:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"well besides the obvious issues (flash/java) whcih i know can be worked around, there's a lot of other more obscure things i think i'd run into, like Wine for instance, no 64-bit version rite?"
2007-10-12T09:44:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"no 64 bit version of wine, but u can run the 32 bit, and if u think about it, u wouldnt want a 64 bit version of wine, because it would be like using x64 windows, which i dont know how good that is"
2007-10-12T09:45:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"i see, so how hard is it to run 32-bit apps? or is it just a matter of simply running it in 32-bit mode...rather than trying to force it to 64...and theres no real problems?"
2007-10-12T09:45:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,you run them just as you would any other program
2007-10-12T09:45:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,really? so any app that doesnt have 64-bit version will run in 32-bit mode no prob?
2007-10-12T09:47:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,and it worked fine? why do i keep hearing that 64-bit isnt 'ready' for desktop use yet
2007-10-12T09:47:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"runs fine, just perfect :)"
2007-10-12T09:48:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"bah...methinks i must do 64-bit, but just to make sure, when u have a 32bit app, what do u have to do specifically to run it in 32bit mode?"
2007-10-12T09:49:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"nothing, they just run"
2007-10-12T09:49:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"but you dont want to install a bunch of 32 bit apps, kinda defeats the purpose of running 64 bit os"
2007-10-12T09:50:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"well of course, anything that had 64bit version id use the 64...but i know not everything does"
2007-10-12T09:50:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"yea, but you shouldnt have problems loading 32 bit apps in 64"
2007-10-12T09:50:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"interesting, and u were able to hack the flash/java plugins to ur 64bit firefox?"
2007-10-12T09:51:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,yea they run fine
2007-10-12T09:51:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"well ubotu doesnt apparently know about it, but its nspluginwrapper"
2007-10-12T09:52:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"interesting, u running gutsy too?"
2007-10-12T09:52:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,yes
2007-10-12T09:54:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"okay im going to grab the 64-bit gutsy image, last time i tried i couldnt boot to a gui with the 64 livecd so that kinda put me off the 64 thing"
2007-10-12T09:55:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,good luck :)
2007-10-12T09:55:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"but i have since upgraded my graphics card to nvidia, so im hoping things will be different"
2007-10-12T10:02:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"what do u think, 7.10-rc-alternate-amd64 or 7.10-rc-desktop-amd64 ?"
2007-10-12T10:02:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,id go desktop and if it doesnt work use the alternate
2007-10-12T10:02:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,i prefer alternate install but the desktop one will let me know initially about hardware support
2007-10-12T10:03:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,gotcha
2007-10-12T10:12:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"im gonna have to disagree somewhat with you on that, compizfusion while mostly eyecandy, DOES give added functionality and features for accessibility"
2007-10-12T10:14:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"there are a whole buncha other things tho, in particular the zoom plug-in, helpful for ppl with vision problems obviously, but also quite useful if im on my bed with wireless keyboard"
2007-10-12T10:15:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,vista's visual effects are SAD compared to compiz
2007-10-12T10:16:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"well some ppl have hard time with it, i did too with ATI card, i got an nvidia card and have had 0 problems"
2007-10-12T10:37:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,u know a way to get xchat to bind a key to insert the nick of the last person u talked to? i know Konversation can do this
2007-10-12T10:37:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,no idea
2007-10-12T10:39:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,lates ;p
2007-10-15T11:23:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,i think u want to probe the module called thermal
2007-10-15T11:32:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,start compiling! itll go up! :)
2007-10-15T11:32:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,but even at bios its usually idling at 55C
2007-10-15T11:32:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"according to the bios, but i imagine thats correct..."
2007-10-15T11:32:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"well i figured there was something wrong, that seemed kinda low"
2007-10-15T11:35:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,what about this coretemp module? how do i get output of that?
2007-10-15T11:36:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"oh darn, okay, really wanted to see what difference is beteween toothpaste and arctic silver ;p"
2007-10-19T07:29:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,hey man
2007-10-19T07:30:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,oh ya ;p 7.10 x64 :)
2007-10-19T07:30:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,that realtime kernel is worth it
2007-10-19T07:31:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,is it now? are u talking about the Ubuntu kernel or a vanilla kernel?
2007-10-19T07:31:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"well im using the vanilla kernel, but the ubuntu one im sure just has lowlatency"
2007-10-19T07:32:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"well i know feisty had a 'lowlatency' version, and i thot gutsy had a newly named 'realtime' version similar, but i havent investigated..."
2007-10-19T07:37:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,have u had any problems with flash on gutsy 64? cuz i havent so far...
2007-10-19T07:37:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,too bad nspluginwrapper wont work with jave....
2007-10-19T07:37:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"ahh yes, how did u handle the java issue btw?"
2007-10-19T07:38:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"nothing so far, i havent really come across anything i need java for, if theres something i absolutely need it for i can use a vm i suppose, im ont going to install firefox 32bit"
2007-10-19T07:39:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,yea i havent really needed java yet so far...but i imagine i'll need it at some point....i thot there was a way to deal with it
2007-10-19T07:39:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,nothin really except for installing 32 bit firefox
2007-10-19T07:40:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,really? thats shitty
2007-10-19T07:58:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,u seen this article? seems interesting...http://www.bit-tech.net/bits/2007/10/16/64-bit_more_than_just_the_ram/1
2007-10-19T09:39:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"so u finally built your own custom kernel that works? I finally concluded that it wasnt worth the effort, only thing i wanted really was the realtime version i think"
2007-10-19T09:40:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"i think it was worth it, optimized for my processor instead of generic x86_64 its amd64 now"
2007-10-19T09:40:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,humm...but i thot ubuntu automatically installed the correct kernel for your architecture...
2007-10-19T09:41:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,as evidenced by uname -a 'Linux ubuntu64 2.6.22-14-generic #1 SMP Sun Oct 14 21:45:15 GMT 2007 x86_64 GNU/Linux'
2007-10-19T09:42:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"Linux dp-lappy 2.6.23.1-dp #1 SMP PREEMPT Mon Oct 15 21:17:16 CDT 2007 x86_64 GNU/Linux   it says x86_64, but its set in the config for my amd k8 family processor, more optimized than generic x86_64 i believe"
2007-10-19T09:43:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"hm, interesting...whats the preempt mean?"
2007-10-19T09:45:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"ah cool, i think im goign to just get the lowlatency kernel meta package thing"
2007-10-19T09:45:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"you can also change the timer frequency of your processor, i bumped mine up to 1000hz which is apparently the best choice for systems requiring fast interactive responses to events"
2007-10-19T09:46:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,no kidding...u did that during setup-xconfig ? my question then is who wouldnt want fast interactive responses to events ??
2007-10-19T09:47:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"i dont know why for sure some of those things arent enabled by default, but i guess its because some processors cant handle it and you would want the config that the most machines would support"
2007-10-19T09:48:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,yea i spose that makes sense....can you really 'feel' it tho? or could it just be psychological? i want to see proof of this lol
2007-10-19T09:49:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,it boots much faster than it did on the generic 2.6.22
2007-10-19T09:49:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,really? it boots faster huh...well i spose that might be because its not loading all those modules maybe?
2007-10-19T09:50:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"well, i didnt mess with the modules yet, i figure i can do that anytime, i wanted to get the processor optimized first"
2007-10-19T09:51:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,oh...but i dont see how processor optimization would really affect boot times...
2007-10-19T09:52:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"who knows, but it is definitely faster"
2007-10-19T09:54:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"yea....i dunno, it is enticing but it sounds like it could be headaches...not to mention taking a couple hours to compile.."
2007-10-19T09:54:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"it takes 45 minutes to an hour, but theres no real headaches if u follow the guide i used, youd have to recompile any extra drivers you had tho (nvidia, etc.)"
2007-10-19T09:56:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,got a link to that guide by chance?
2007-10-19T09:58:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,http://www.howtoforge.com/kernel_compilation_ubuntu
2007-10-19T10:02:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"on that page is the first step at all required, section 1.1"
2007-10-19T10:02:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,oh...maybe i shouldnt do this tonight...i'll never get anywhere with apt-get...
2007-10-19T10:03:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,u should start it compiling tonight and it will be ready in the morning :)
2007-10-19T10:04:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,well that was my plan...but im afraid if i have to grab packages from apt .... might take all night just to do that with the servers being hammered
2007-10-19T10:05:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"no, i upgraded to RC1 64 last week"
2007-10-19T10:05:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"i should say, i clean-installed to new partition"
2007-10-19T10:06:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"ic, i did that with the rc as well, then kept up-to-date until it stopped giving updates a few days ago"
2007-10-19T10:06:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"it was givin me updates yesterday, but nothing today, i assumed because of all the traffic"
2007-10-19T10:08:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,this article is a decent read: http://www.bit-tech.net/bits/2007/10/16/64-bit_more_than_just_the_ram/1
2007-10-19T10:09:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,lol yeh
2007-10-19T10:09:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,can u post your uname -a output again

2007-10-19T10:11:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"thats the one i used, newest one i believe"
2007-10-19T10:11:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,no? which one do i want then lol? http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/

2007-10-19T10:12:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,isnt that what i just said?
2007-10-19T10:12:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"oh, i linked to the Patch...gotcha"
2007-10-19T10:13:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"no, yours was the patch, that was the actual kernel"
2007-10-19T10:13:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"ic ic, is the realtime thing a patch i gotta add?"
2007-10-19T10:14:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"no, just an option you set in the config, its actually low-latency, btw are you using an amd64 chip?"
2007-10-19T10:14:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,no im using Pentium D 2.8ghz @ ~3.4ghz
2007-10-19T10:21:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"lol, thats pretty harsh ;p"
2007-10-19T10:24:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,dont u think that guide u gave me is a little old? 6.10? or do u think its fine?
2007-10-19T10:24:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"its the one i followed, works just fine, makes deb packages for the kernel and headers, and when u install them it adds entries to grub"
2007-10-19T10:25:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"cool cool, was just wonderin about step 1.1"
2007-10-19T10:25:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"yea dont worry about that one, i didnt do it, everything else shold be fine, skip the patches thing unless you are patching your kernel, which i doubt u are"
2007-10-19T10:26:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,yea im all set with patching
2007-10-19T10:37:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,compiling yet?! =)
2007-10-19T10:37:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"lol...no, stuck on step 3.../usr/src/linux folder doesnt exist...?"
2007-10-19T10:38:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"its a symlink, did you extract the kernel source to /usr/src?"
2007-10-19T10:38:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,all u gotta do is: ln -s /usr/src/linux-2.6.23.1 /usr/src/linux
2007-10-19T10:38:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,i extracted it to ~/
2007-10-19T10:38:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,move it to /usr/src
2007-10-19T10:38:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,kk
2007-10-19T10:38:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,then do that ln -s command
2007-10-19T10:45:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"hmm the make menuconfig has a lottttaa options, maybe i should just mess with this tomorow..."
2007-10-19T10:46:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,i just messed with the Processor Types and Features part
2007-10-19T10:46:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,haha i see
2007-10-19T10:46:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,you can go back and recompile again any time
2007-10-19T10:46:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"youll always have the config, and you can go back and trim out modules that you dont want"
2007-10-19T10:52:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"k im setting 3 options, processor type to p4..the 1000hz thing, and the Preemptible Kernel (low-latency desktop) option"
2007-10-19T10:52:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"sweet, good luck :)"
2007-10-19T10:52:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,u did remember to load your previous config right?
2007-10-19T10:53:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,yea...pretty sure i did that right...
2007-10-19T10:53:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,the worst that can happen is it doesnt compile and u have to try again lol
2007-10-19T10:53:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,kk
2007-10-19T11:07:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"okay im compiling...gonna hit the sakc, thx for ur help"
2007-10-22T06:13:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,whatsup shrek
2007-10-22T06:14:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"I got it compiled, tried booting with it, nothing worked properly, screen was in 'low res' mode, no sound, nothing....i think i messed up the part of copying my current config over"
2007-10-22T06:15:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,you maybe forgot to load the configuration during the menuconfig
2007-10-22T06:15:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"i didnt forget to do that, but i may have put the .config file in the wrong dir or copied or incorrectly"
2007-10-22T06:16:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"when radioaktivstorm comes back and is looking for me, tell em ill brb k?"
2007-10-22T06:17:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,alright
2007-10-22T06:29:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"hey i wanna trim out the 'fat' from the kernel this time before i compile it, it seems to be compiling a shitload of modules that i obviously dont need"
2007-10-22T06:29:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"thats true, i was going to do that too, but im kinda lazy"
2007-10-22T06:29:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,well lets do it then ;P
2007-10-22T06:30:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"alright, ill start lookin through, make sure u type lsmod and make sure you include those modules in your kernel"
2007-10-22T06:30:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,kk
2007-10-22T06:31:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,is there a way i can tell that im using my current kernel config when im runing make menuconfig?
2007-10-22T06:31:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"well, your going to want to copy the latest config from /boot to your kernel source directory and call the file .config, then load it when u get into the menuconfig"
2007-10-22T06:32:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"i know and thats what i did, but i dthink i miessed that part up somehow last time, how do i check if its actually the right .config file from my current config?"
2007-10-22T06:33:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"its not really possible, you just kinda gotta assume that it is, if u copy the config from your currently running kernel, it should be right"
2007-10-22T06:34:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,well the only thing i can conclude is that i messed that step up because the kernel didnt boot like a ubuntu kernel should...lotta my hardware was not working
2007-10-22T06:35:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"thats what you were saying, did u run the compile command just like it was on that tutorial? it needs the initramfs flag so it loads drivers at boot"
2007-10-22T06:35:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"pretty sure, maybe thats wht i messed up, i dunno ;p"
2007-10-22T06:36:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"anyways, see if u can figure out how to trim the kernel down so compiling doesnt take so long this time ;p"
2007-10-22T06:37:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"well i know how, its just kinda a long process of going through all the submenus and disabling drivers, and its kinda pointless to do it now, ill just wait until i wanna upgrade my kernel again, and i may not even do it then lol, the only thing thats bad is it will take long to compile, its not going to make your computer run any faster to disable all that stuff because they are just modules and arent even being loaded any"
2007-10-22T06:38:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"hmm, okay, but there are also about 8000 other options in there, there must be some more ways to optimize it beyond setting your processor type and the realtime thing"
2007-10-22T06:39:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"also do u think it's worth it to try and add in the restricted drivers, only one i need is nvidia"
2007-10-22T06:40:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"u cant really add that because you dont have the source code for it, youll just have to recompile it upon booting the new kernel"
2007-10-22T06:40:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,ah but the ubuntu kernel guide does mention adding restricted drivers module
2007-10-22T06:41:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"hmm, i never tried it"
2007-10-22T07:07:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,no i didnt really setup anything i dont recall...i havent it installed it yet on gutsy cuz i thot gutsy had its 'prefetch' thingy
2007-10-22T07:08:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"there's a way to output its logfile, and it will tell u if it has anything cached, when i was running it, it would sometimes tell me it had cached a few things"
2007-10-22T09:53:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,rm -r
2007-10-22T09:54:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,rm -r /path/to/dir/ ?
2007-10-22T09:55:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,im deleting my linux-2.6.23.1/ dir from /usr/src so i can make sure i have a fresh start...
2007-10-22T09:55:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,you could just run: make clean
2007-10-22T09:55:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,well too late now ;p
2007-10-22T10:00:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,perhaps my last try wasnt successful because the vanilla kernel was lacking some of the patches that would be in a ubuntu kernel?
2007-10-22T10:10:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,networking using a vista guest is apparently broken in virtualbox
2007-10-22T10:11:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,even with the VBoxGuestAdditions vista doesnt work?
2007-10-22T10:11:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"no, vista wont detect any networking device at all..."
2007-10-22T10:12:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,i didnt set a single option in vbox for my networking
2007-10-22T10:12:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,thats cuz vista sucks lol
2007-10-22T10:12:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,under the machine settings...under network ...
2007-10-22T10:18:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,nite

2007-10-26T08:23:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,yes! finally today i got nvidia drivers working

2007-10-26T08:25:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"i dont know how i fixed it either, it was all b0rked, even on my old kernel when i tried to install it"
2007-10-26T08:25:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"that happens to me from time to time, never really konw how things get fixed but they do"
2007-10-26T08:26:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,have u had any stability issues with ur kernel? mines pretty stable altho a game crashed on me earlier today...just concerned about the pre-emptible part...dont see many ppl recomending it
2007-10-26T08:27:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,i havent had a single problem yet
2007-10-26T08:27:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"yea...well its runnin pretty good, maybe just a fluke, it was with et:quake wars, did u try that btw?"
2007-10-26T08:27:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"havent yet, the demo thing i downloaded was an exe, so im going to have to look for the iso of it, btw IS it an iso?"
2007-10-26T08:28:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"lol no, they just released the linux native version of it...its a bash installer"
2007-10-26T08:28:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"well i got that, but it asks me to insert a cd or something, i didnt have one though, maybe i got the wrong installer or something"
2007-10-26T08:29:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"its based on the quake4 engine, quake4 is linux-native as well"
2007-10-26T08:29:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"u probly got the full game, u want the demo..."
2007-10-26T08:29:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"damn...ill look into it, but i dont game much on my pc, i use my psp for that :)"
2007-11-06T08:32:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"i feel like slackware is kinda behind the times with their release schedule, they just finally moved to 2.6 kernel? lol"
2007-11-06T08:33:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"theyve had a 2.6 kernel for a long time, it jsut wasnt default, very easy to install though, their software isnt behind the times anymore really"
2007-11-06T08:33:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"i used slackware many years ago, back then it was the best, but i dont think so anyore"
2007-11-06T09:01:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,still running a custom kernel?
2007-11-06T09:02:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,yeap
2007-11-06T09:02:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,its runnin just fine
2007-11-06T09:03:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,was workin on compiling 2.6.23-mm kernel
2007-11-06T09:03:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,haha nice
2007-11-06T09:04:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,anything interesting in there? ive never used git before ;p
2007-11-06T09:04:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"b43 driver, supposed to replace bcm43xx i guess"
2007-11-06T09:04:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"ah, well any added wireless functionality is a welcome change"
2007-11-06T09:05:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,i want them to merge the ra2x00 drivers
2007-11-06T09:06:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"yea, well i fixed that problem by just swapping my wifi card like i told u ;p"
2007-11-06T09:07:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"yea well has driver built into kernel, its an older cisco aironet card, only 802.11b but i don care"
2007-11-06T09:08:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"yep, 11mbps is fine for me"
2007-11-06T09:08:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,u ever tried the -mm patch?
2007-11-06T09:08:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,i dont think so
2007-11-06T09:10:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,anything special in the -mm?
2007-11-06T09:11:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,there's a LOT of (NEW) and (EXPERIMENTAL) stuff in it from what ive looked at
2007-11-06T09:11:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,ill take a look as i was just about to compile 2.6.23.1 once again...
2007-11-06T09:11:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"supports reiser4, which is why i grabbed it, but it has some interesting performance options under processor section"
2007-11-06T09:12:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"i was curious tho, i patched mine against 2.6.23, i thot thats what u were sposed to do if u were gonna patch, rather than use 2.6.23.1 (since its already patched??)"
2007-11-06T09:12:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"maybe, i dont konw for sure"
2007-11-06T09:13:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,that confused me
2007-11-06T09:13:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"but about kernels in general, isnt the .1 the patch level?"
2007-11-06T09:13:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,yes
2007-11-06T09:14:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"right, so therefore ur sposed to use the baselevel 2.6.23 if ur gona patch it? i dunno"
2007-11-06T09:15:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"not necessarily, im sure the -mm would patch against the .1 just fine, but i may be wrong, im not a kernel guru :P"
2007-11-06T09:15:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,yea me either ;p
2007-11-06T09:15:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"well u should try -mm patch, its right there on front page of kernel.org so it must be fairly good"
2007-11-06T09:16:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"lol, 'if its there, it must be good'"
2007-11-06T09:16:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"well okay, but i mean, its in common use is what i meant"
2007-11-06T09:16:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,ill give it a go :) gonna patch it against 2.6.23.1
2007-11-06T09:16:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"ok, good idea, i'll try against 2.6.23"
2007-11-06T09:24:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,dyndns is for different purpose i think
2007-11-06T09:24:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"yea, opendns is for a dns server right?"
2007-11-06T09:25:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,its free dns servers u can use instead of your ip's to resolve hostnames
2007-11-06T09:25:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,*isp's
2007-11-06T09:25:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,yes dyndns is that too
2007-11-06T09:44:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,yea thats what i heard too
2007-11-06T09:28:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,did u use patch -p1 ?
2007-11-06T09:29:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,yea
2007-11-06T09:29:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"ok, i never know what -p option to put :P"
2007-11-06T09:29:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,bzcat | blah blah patch -p1
2007-11-06T09:29:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,i donno what it does either ;p
2007-11-06T09:34:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"its whining at me, wont make :("
2007-11-06T09:34:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"oh ya i had that problem, its just the mm patch"
2007-11-06T09:35:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,what u gotta do is edit the Makefile and find where it says Arch ?=
2007-11-06T09:35:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"yea i noticed, how can i compile if it wont make? =P"
2007-11-06T09:36:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"and then put in $(SUBARCH), so it will look like this:   ARCH  ?= $(SUBARCH)"
2007-11-06T09:36:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,he just forgot to specify the arch directory i read
2007-11-06T09:38:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"im confused on that arch thing, should i set the environment variable SUBARCH to something or what?"
2007-11-06T09:39:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,edit the Makefile so that the line: ARCH looks like this:   ARCH  ?= $(SUBARCH)
2007-11-06T09:42:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,compiling now... :)
2007-11-06T09:42:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,lol that was quick...did u check out any of the options?
2007-11-06T09:42:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"the tickless kernel thing looks kinda neat, better power use, but only good for laptops so i didnt use"
2007-11-06T09:43:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,not sure about the 2nd option
2007-11-06T09:43:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"yea i read about that for 24, but i also read that it doesnt make THAT much of a difference"
2007-11-06T09:45:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"apparently it helps a lot for VM's tho, reduces their cpu load when idle"
2007-11-06T09:45:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,brb rebooting
2007-11-06T09:46:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"ic, i dont use vms much, but ill have to enable it when i go through this thing again, i gota ll day off tomorrow, gonna go through and trim this kernel down to the bare essentials"
2007-11-06T09:48:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"bahh this is annoying, i can connect to irc but i cant seem to load any websites..."
2007-11-06T09:49:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,just sits there saying connecting to ubuntuforums.org...
2007-11-06T09:49:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"thats too bad, i hate that when i compile a new kernel and it doenst work right, such a waste of time"
2007-11-06T09:50:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,no thats not why i havent even compiled that yet...only thing i did was move my computer to a different house ... different wireless network
2007-11-06T09:52:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,in /etc/hosts you can set that
2007-11-06T11:42:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,u get that mm kernel compiled?
2007-11-20T08:49:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,aint seen u in a while where ya been?
2007-11-20T08:48:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,hey a
2007-11-20T08:49:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"here and there, busy with school n deer hunting"
2007-11-20T08:49:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"lol, deer hunting...where are u from"
2007-11-20T08:50:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"ah, we got that big out here, im from new hampshire"
2007-11-20T08:50:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"im not running ubuntu anymore, im back on slamd64"
2007-11-20T08:51:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,whatever for?
2007-11-20T08:52:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"i dunno, i just seem to feel more comfortable in a slackware environment, i dont like all the automation that ubuntu has, and just little things here and there that i am used to i spose"
2007-11-20T08:56:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,why slamd64 tho? if i do end up switching distros i think i'd go to Arch
2007-11-20T08:57:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"i dunno, im used to it i guess, i like slackware alot, and slamd64 is slackware ported to x86_64"
2007-11-20T08:57:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"oh i see, makes sense"
2007-11-20T08:58:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,no he's talkin about the bigmem kernel option
2007-11-20T08:58:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"its only in recent 32-bit kernels, its a hack to get up to 4GB of memory"
2007-11-20T09:05:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,u know what file controls loading of modules on startup?
2007-11-20T09:06:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,umm...not exactly sure in ubuntu....something in /etc/modprobe.d/ iirc
2007-11-20T09:06:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,there's a bunch of files in /etc/modprobe.d   wish there was just one....
2007-11-20T09:07:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"things liek that pissed me off lol, didnt feel like figuring out, in slack its all in /etc/rc.d"
2007-11-20T09:07:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"yea, i hear ya"
2007-11-20T09:07:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"i rlly wanna try Arch, but im afraid to undertake such a task as switching distros right now"
2007-11-20T09:08:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,why arch?
2007-11-20T09:08:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"you shold go with a REAL distribution, like slackware :)"
2007-11-20T09:08:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"its got some really good reviews, and it sounds like an 'advanced' linux distro, but not as technical as slack"
2007-11-20T09:09:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,slackware appears to be lacking a package manager that solves dependencies
2007-11-20T09:09:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,that is true
2007-11-20T09:09:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"thing is, ubuntu has a really big community that i like a lot, thats a main reason for me not to switch"
2007-11-20T09:10:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"yea thats true, good for learning, you are relativly new to linux right?"
2007-11-20T09:10:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,tho i do feel like a distro that wasnt so bloated like Arch is right for me
2007-11-20T09:10:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"I am relatively new, 6months at most"
2007-11-20T09:10:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,tho i've been learning pretty quick
2007-11-20T09:12:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"yea, well i learned starting with ubuntu on 4.10 (warty) used ubuntu until breezy or so, then slack, some gentoo, now i just go back and forth, the more time i spend in linux the more i realize that most distros are pretty much the same, aside from where some files are located, and package management"
2007-11-20T09:13:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"true...but isnt it kind of a pain to switch distros? i mean i do have my /home on seperate partition, also have /boot now...but still, takes a lotta work to get back to where u were"
2007-11-20T09:17:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,tried compiling 2.6.24-rc3?
2007-11-20T09:17:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,lol no ;p
2007-11-20T09:18:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,i just actually recompiled 2.6.23.1 with softraid support compiled in
2007-11-20T09:18:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"im compiling now, running rc2 right now"
2007-11-20T09:18:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,anything exciting in the changelog? ;p
2007-11-20T09:18:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"nothing too spectacular, you know 2.6.23.8 is out right? they went from .2 to .8 in like 2 hours lol"
2007-11-20T09:19:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,wtf? no...i didnt even no .2 was out
2007-11-20T09:19:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,holy crap ur right
2007-11-20T09:19:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"damnit, i just recompiled .1 about an hour ago"
2007-11-20T09:20:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"last friday, they had 2.6.23.2, at like 11am, and when i came back at like 2pm it was up to .8 lol"
2007-11-20T09:20:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,welcome to my life lol
2007-11-20T09:21:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"lol, so like, are u testing out any features of .24 or ?"
2007-11-20T09:22:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"not so much, my broadcom wireless card took a shit, otherwise id be trying the b43 driver, apparently my sd card reader in my laptop works now, ill have to see here in a minute, but other than that not much really..."
2007-11-20T09:22:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"the -mm patch has lots of experimental stuff in it, i compiled it once but couldnt get it to run"
2007-11-20T09:22:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,i wanted to try Reiser4 ;P
2007-11-20T09:23:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"thats whay u were saying, reiser4 eh?"
2007-11-20T09:23:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,yea lol
2007-11-20T09:23:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,ext4 is in .23.1 i believe...
2007-11-20T09:23:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"ext4 doesnt seem to offer much, just some more security options....nothin in terms of performance from what ive read"
2007-11-20T09:24:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"thats what i read as well, not really a desktop fs either, more for servers i guess"
2007-11-20T09:29:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,i found this review rather convincing for ArchLinux
2007-11-20T09:30:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,http://usalug.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=10256
2007-11-20T09:30:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,tho i spose it may be rather biasd
2007-11-20T09:31:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,or actually check this page out: http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_vs_Others
2007-11-20T09:33:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"yea, i dont see how dependancy checking is not a problem for you..."
2007-11-20T09:34:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,also the i686 optimization i find appealing
2007-11-20T09:34:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"heh, if i need a dependency, i get it"
2007-11-20T09:34:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,ur running 64 bit anyways right?
2007-11-20T09:34:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,true..
2007-11-20T09:34:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,i guess tahts a moot point then..
2007-11-20T09:35:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,but isnt x86_64 just an i686 architecture with added amd64 instruction set?
2007-11-20T09:35:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"i mean, on the 32-bit side, they're the same"
2007-11-20T09:35:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"i dunno for sure, sounds right lol"
2007-11-20T09:37:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,thats my understanding...but i may be wrong
2007-11-20T09:37:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"im downloading arch right now, gonna install on a vm, ill let u know if i approve =P"
2007-11-20T09:38:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,i think i will install it as a vm along with you
2007-11-20T09:38:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,going with core or ftp?
2007-11-20T09:39:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"im guessing u will because its a mixing of gentoo, slack, and debian"
2007-11-20T09:39:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,the 'no frills' distros ;p
2007-11-20T09:39:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,core...the ftp package is only 42mb lol
2007-11-20T09:40:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"i spose, heh, well see"
2007-11-20T09:41:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,do u enable VT-x/AMD-V in vbox? i enable it but i donno if its doing any good
2007-11-20T09:41:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"i do, but your processor has to support it, i chose something in my bios for virtualization"
2007-11-20T09:42:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,bahh why cant u just use vbox ;p
2007-11-20T09:42:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"cuz i didnt feel like compiling it, they dont have a slack package"
2007-11-20T09:42:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"i chose support for some virutalization options in kernel config, never saw anything in bios for that"
2007-11-20T09:43:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"it may have something to do with the kernel options too, im not exactly sure"
2007-11-20T09:45:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,okay im at the arch install program
2007-11-20T09:45:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,i'll wait for u
2007-11-20T09:46:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"i got 8 minutes left, my connection is slow"
2007-11-20T09:46:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"ah, what are u on?"
2007-11-20T09:46:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"its a 3 meg connection, but i swear im getting throttled"
2007-11-20T09:46:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,sounds it
2007-11-20T09:51:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,":) im beginning install, gonna use reiserfs ;p"
2007-11-20T09:53:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"so far i like the package selection system, tho i dont think i'd ever bother going thru this huge list"
2007-11-20T09:54:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,booting the iso :)
2007-11-20T09:54:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,in the installer i mean
2007-11-20T09:54:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,but i imagine one could make a very lean system this way
2007-11-20T09:54:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,you can always add more later right?
2007-11-20T09:54:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,exactly!
2007-11-20T09:55:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,tho actually most of these seem rather essential so far
2007-11-20T09:55:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,oh yea
2007-11-20T09:56:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,ncurses ;p
2007-11-20T09:59:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"i dont like how it wants to use a /home partition by default, thats kinda annoying to me already"
2007-11-20T09:59:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,what do u mean? i just did the auto partition
2007-11-20T10:01:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"the partitioner on it makes a /home partition by default, i dont like that"
2007-11-20T10:01:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,oh...well why not? sure wished ubuntu had done that when i first installed it
2007-11-20T10:02:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"oh my lord, now im just at a list of system config files im sposed to edit with Vi lol"
2007-11-20T10:02:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"i dont like to restrict my / partion at all, whenever i make a /home partition i always fill it up"
2007-11-20T10:02:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,think ima wait for u 2 catch up
2007-11-20T10:03:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"im installing base, devel, and lib"
2007-11-20T10:03:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"oh, i install base, lib, support"
2007-11-20T10:03:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,probly shoulda just grabbed ema ll
2007-11-20T10:04:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"ok, i added support"
2007-11-20T10:04:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,installing packages
2007-11-20T10:05:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,oops i think i just started building the system
2007-11-20T10:05:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,lol
2007-11-20T10:05:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,this is gonna be a real clumsy installation
2007-11-20T10:05:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,lol
2007-11-20T10:07:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,my rc3 kernel is ready too :)
2007-11-20T10:07:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,o boy ;p
2007-11-20T10:08:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,im restarting the install lol
2007-11-20T10:08:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,I F'ed it up
2007-11-20T10:11:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,are u at the configure stage?
2007-11-20T10:12:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"its installing packages, step 3 i believe"
2007-11-20T10:12:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,alright
2007-11-20T10:14:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,seen ubuntu-jeos?
2007-11-20T10:14:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,no what is it?
2007-11-20T10:14:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,ubuntu specifically designed to be run as a vm
2007-11-20T10:14:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,no kidding...cool
2007-11-20T10:24:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,lol how do i make a new user in the cmd prompt?
2007-11-20T10:25:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,adduser
2007-11-20T10:27:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,okay what else do i need to provide to useradd?
2007-11-20T10:28:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,maybe adduser  one of them doesnt require parameters and prompts you for everything
2007-11-20T10:29:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"yea that works, thx"
2007-11-20T10:32:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"my install is done, going to reboot to my new kernel also..brb"
2007-11-20T10:48:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,it work?
2007-11-20T10:49:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"not really...its whining about my locale, i dont think i set it up right"
2007-11-20T10:49:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"i didnt feel like editing a bunch of files during the install, and i think its fuxt up"
2007-11-20T10:49:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,me too...i dunno how to install any new packages
2007-11-20T10:49:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,doesnt seem like a very friendly installer
2007-11-20T10:50:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"yea, i run pacman and it says current locale is invalid using default"
2007-11-20T10:50:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"on an unrelated note, do u specify 'vga=xxx' in your kernel boot line in menu.lst ?"
2007-11-20T10:50:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,on my host or guest?
2007-11-20T10:51:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,host
2007-11-20T10:51:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"i use lilo, but i use 791"
2007-11-20T10:51:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,i set it to 773 on the arch install and i get a nice 1024x768 tty...but doesnt seemt o work when i set it on my host config
2007-11-20T10:52:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,mine is widescreen tho
2007-11-20T10:52:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,humm....i got a 1280x1024LCD ... should i try 794? (1280@64k) ?
2007-11-20T10:53:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"its worth a shot, but hard to say if it will work or not"
2007-11-20T10:53:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"i wanna boot without splash, but i'd like to see the boot messages in 1280 res....hard to see at default"
2007-11-20T10:55:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,ive already decided im not too fond of arch
2007-11-20T10:55:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"lol, u dint even give it a shot ;p"
2007-11-20T10:55:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,so far im liking the simplified config files
2007-12-05T11:20:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,whatup meng ;p
2007-12-05T11:21:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"pretty good man, im running Arch now ;)"
2007-12-05T11:21:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,i like it...tho i dont have too much else to compare it to except ubuntu
2007-12-05T11:23:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,u still running slamd64?
2007-12-05T11:25:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"slack is definitely a good distro, but I think u might really like Arch, mostly because of its rolling release system, you're always up to date"
2007-12-05T11:25:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,how does it work? just auto updates all the time or what?
2007-12-05T11:25:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,yea i look forward to running pacman -Syu  everytime i get home from work ;)
2007-12-05T11:26:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"running that synchronizes the repos, any updates get installed, recently we got updates to things like Xorg-server and nautilus"
2007-12-05T11:26:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"heh, i just recently set up a cron job to rsync slamd64-current, so now ill stay up to date too"
2007-12-05T11:27:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,rather than the terribly un-exciting updates that ubuntu delivers ;p
2007-12-05T11:27:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,it uses Pacman
2007-12-05T11:27:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,along with ABS (arch build system) which is similar in concept to BSD's Ports system
2007-12-05T11:28:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"mm, they're neither"
2007-12-05T11:28:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,they come in .pkg.tar.gz format ;p
2007-12-05T11:29:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,but basically they are all built from ABS using Arch-made PKGBUILD files
2007-12-05T11:29:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"the PKGBUILD files are pretty small and just give compiler-flags, location of the source files to download, and any other options"
2007-12-05T11:30:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"and u just makepkg -i with the pkgbuild file and it downloads the source, compiles, and makes a working package for u to use with pacman"
2007-12-05T11:30:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"ic, sounds kinda like slackbuilds, except they dont point to a download site"
2007-12-05T11:30:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,slackbuilds require source files to be local?
2007-12-05T11:30:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,yea i think its a similar concept
2007-12-05T11:31:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,tho honestly i havent even built anything myself yet ;p
2007-12-05T11:31:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"tho with that new flash update, i might try it"
2007-12-05T11:32:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"heh, so when you install soemthign, i has to compile it each time? or your pacman gets precompiled packages?"
2007-12-05T11:32:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,arch gets binary updates
2007-12-05T11:32:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,it is not like gentoo in that respect
2007-12-05T11:45:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,so how is your dependency management going? ;p
2007-12-05T11:46:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"i dont really have any issues, granted a few things i need to compile a dependency for, most things work just fine"
2007-12-05T11:47:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"hehe, yea im just giving u crap ;p"
2007-12-05T11:47:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,are u using RPM's for package installs or no?
2007-12-05T11:48:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"now, slackware packages (.tgz) or source compiling"
2007-12-05T11:48:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,does slack use rpm?
2007-12-05T11:49:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"no, it uses slackware packages which are .tgz"
2007-12-05T11:49:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,oh k
2007-12-05T11:49:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,he should be able to burn that iso using nautilus by default...
2007-12-05T11:50:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"well it is breezy, ubuntu 5.10"
2007-12-05T11:51:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"Oh, i wonder what version of Gnome that is ;p"
2007-12-05T11:58:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,the file:// format is gnome-vfs stuff i believe
2007-12-05T11:58:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,o wait nvm
2007-12-06T10:29:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,whatup meng
2007-12-06T10:30:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"not much, just fixing / tweaking various things"
2007-12-06T10:30:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"u pointed him to broadcom firmwares, i have a different chip but how would i flash the firmware on it?"
2007-12-06T10:31:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"you dont flash the firmware at all, it gets loaded upon boot"
2007-12-06T10:31:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,Aironet (cisco) 802.11b
2007-12-06T10:31:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,uses airo module
2007-12-06T10:43:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"no idea, just wondering whats inside of it =P"
2007-12-06T10:32:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,well it tells me everytime i boot that it can't do WPA and such without version x.x firmware
2007-12-06T10:32:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,i mean i dont need wpa now but itd be nice to have my card upgraded firmware..
2007-12-06T10:33:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"cisco has a flashing program and the firmwares on their site, but the app only runs in winxp ;("
2007-12-06T10:33:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,okay well what if i have the firmware?
2007-12-06T10:34:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,lemme see
2007-12-06T10:37:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,gimpshop = gimp with photoshop keybindings
2007-12-06T10:41:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,okay i have the firmware file (its a .IMG)
2007-12-06T10:42:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"hmm, i got no idea how to extract it, wonder if its liek a cd image...you could try mounting it like an iso: mount -o loop"
2007-12-06T10:42:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,well i thot that was the file u used to flash
2007-12-06T10:42:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,very possible
2007-12-06T10:42:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,i mean what type of file are we looking for here?
2007-12-06T10:44:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,its a binary
2007-12-06T11:09:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,nites
2007-12-14T12:52:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,still helpin the noobs eh? ;p
2007-12-14T12:52:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"yea, once in awhile"
2007-12-14T12:53:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,everyone does
2007-12-14T12:53:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,lol
2007-12-14T12:53:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,still usin slamd64?
2007-12-14T12:54:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,u kno it
2007-12-14T12:54:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"arch is good, i just switched to Openbox"
2007-12-14T12:54:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,yeah
2007-12-14T12:55:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,its a more l33t WM
2007-12-14T12:56:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,why are u guys compiling pidgin? ;p
2007-12-14T12:57:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,slamd64 doesnt have a package for 2.3.1
2007-12-14T12:57:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"hmm, let me check the arch repos ;)"
2007-12-14T13:00:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"damn im suprised, only pidgin 2.3.0-2 in the arch repos"
2007-12-14T13:06:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,you dont compile your kernel manually?
2007-12-14T13:06:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"well u certainly can, but let me see here"
2007-12-14T13:07:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"i see, what u running currently?"
2007-12-14T13:07:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,2.6.23-ARCH SMP PREEMPT
2007-12-14T13:07:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,and yes
2007-12-14T13:08:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,Linux 2.6.24-rc5 x86_64
2007-12-14T13:08:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,lol that the latest?
2007-12-18T10:34:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,i do that all the time from school lol
2007-12-18T10:35:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,i always just use putty
2007-12-18T10:45:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,i think chmod -R /dir/ will do it recursively
2007-12-18T10:45:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,yes it will
2007-12-18T10:45:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,:)
2007-12-18T10:54:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,u have any experience with unetbootin? ;p
2007-09-28T10:24:00.000Z,Evanlec,,oh lord can someone please help me...my drive has become locked 'read-only' after enabling the aname and writeback options on my root partition thru fstab
2007-09-28T10:25:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,dont enable those options?
2007-10-09T09:43:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,gentoo
2007-10-09T09:47:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,i was just about to look into that
2007-10-09T10:03:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,im installing it right now
2007-10-09T10:03:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,but will u be able to benchmark it?
2007-10-09T10:04:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,i suppose i could
2007-10-09T10:04:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,well otherwise your results would be rather subjective dont u think?
2007-10-09T10:05:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"i suppose, but i like to think that it would run better with a low latency kernel, it would only make sense i suppose"
2007-10-09T10:06:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"i dont necessarily understand what a low-latency kernel does, and why default kernels aren't 'low-latency' to begin with"
2007-10-09T10:06:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,what would i use to benchmark? ive never really done it before
2007-10-09T10:07:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"not sure lol, theres one called LMbench"
2007-10-09T10:21:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,u using feisty or gutsy?
2007-10-09T10:22:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"probably not, apparently the mirrors have packages that will break your system, i havent upgraded in a couple days"
2007-10-09T10:22:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"yea, well i wasnt going to dist-upgrade, was just gonna get new kernel...but maybe thats a no no without upgrading distro"
2007-10-09T10:23:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"it can become complicated, but its possible"
2007-10-09T10:24:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"i always recommend a clean install, but ill prolly upgrade myself lol"
2007-10-09T10:25:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"heh yea....i dunno, im iffy about how to backup my /home folder and restore it on the new install...."
2007-10-09T10:25:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"im going to kill my xserver and try out those benchmarks, ill be back in a bit with a report :)"
2007-10-09T10:25:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,plus i wanted to setup raid/lvm but frostburn tells me raid0 isnt worth the speed increase it gives
2007-10-09T10:25:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"sweet, i couldnt figure out how to run them from the man page but yea do that ;p"
2007-10-09T10:26:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"i konw nothing about raid0 lol, back in a flash..."
2007-10-10T09:18:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"ext3 journals, ext2 doesnt"
2007-10-10T09:18:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"right i know, but journaling isnt related to fragmentation correct?"
2007-10-10T09:19:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"hey by the way, did u ever test out that RT kernel last night?"
2007-10-10T09:19:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"it wouldnt boot, i was gonna compile one but i got lazy"
2007-10-10T09:20:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,wouldn't boot? thats not good...it should be the same as the gutsy kernel just with the rt patch...
2007-10-10T09:21:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"yea, it was -13 tho, and i heard that was giving some people problems, im using -12 right now"
2007-10-10T09:21:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,oh....well i hope i get a chance to try it out when i upgrade to gutsy
2007-10-10T08:47:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,that loads modules right away when u choose your kernel so things like mounting your root partition work before modules for it would be loaded
2007-10-10T08:47:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"i see, isnt it possible to not use initrd?"
2007-10-10T08:48:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,is there any implicit advantage in doing that?
2007-10-10T08:49:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"just to not have to make an initrd, i generally try to do that because its just one last step you have to do when compiling a kernel"
2007-10-10T08:49:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,you try to avoid making an initrd?
2007-10-10T08:49:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"yes, as much as possible"
2007-10-10T08:50:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"I used to compile kernels way back on redhat 7 i believe, am interested in doing it here on ubuntu, not because im a developer by any means, but just wanted to tweak and make a lean & fast kernel"
2007-10-10T08:52:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,just use a config from /boot and make sure to do a 'make oldconfig' first
2007-10-10T08:52:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,are you compiling a Ubuntu kernel or a stock kernel from kernel.org
2007-10-10T08:53:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,a vanilla kernel from kernel.org
2007-10-10T08:53:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,im guessing the vanilla kernel is a lot leaner than the ubuntu one
2007-10-10T08:54:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,is there any pitfalls i should watch out for when trying to do this myself?
2007-10-10T08:55:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"you shouldnt have any problems, just dont overwrite your other kernel images and boot options for them"
2007-10-10T08:55:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"right, well it has a lot of added hardware support, being those modules rite?"
2007-10-10T08:56:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"yes, its compiled for almost all kinds of hardware, obviously you dont have a need for all of them, but they are mostly modules, its not that the actual kernel image is bloated"
2007-10-10T08:56:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,oh i see
2007-10-10T08:57:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,do you have a link to a howto for compiling a linux kernel source ?
2007-10-10T08:58:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,i think so lemme check...
2007-10-10T09:00:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"i dont really have a link for it i guess, i just kinda know how to do it lol"
2007-10-10T09:13:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,im compiling it now :)
2007-10-10T09:15:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,compiling 2.6.23 vanilla?
2007-10-10T09:17:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,so far im planning to put in the latest nvidia driver and the RT2500 driver (my wifi card)
2007-10-10T09:29:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,how long on the kernel compile you estimate?
2007-10-10T09:30:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"forever prolly lol, i didnt uncheck most of the modules, so its compiling almost all of them, but i wanna get a kernel running before i start trimming it down"
2007-10-10T09:30:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"Oh, i heard 3-4 hours was average...lol"
2007-10-10T09:31:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"i doubt 3-4 hrs, im running dualcore turion64's it shouldnt take THAT long lol"
2007-10-10T09:31:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,lol yeah...im runnin a pentiumD @ 3.4ghz
2007-10-10T10:04:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,damn 1569 modules lol
2007-10-11T09:50:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,how goes it
2007-10-11T09:51:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,really...so what does that mean? you didnt compile the right headers for your hard drive controler?
2007-10-11T09:52:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,apparently not...im workin on it
2007-10-11T09:52:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,u using SATA?
2007-10-11T09:52:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,u compiled in the SATA support right? ;p
2007-10-11T09:52:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,i have to sata driver (sata_nv) built in
2007-10-11T09:53:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"okay just makin sure, figured u probly thot of that ;p"
2007-10-11T09:57:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,u ever had any luck getting extra buttons working on a mouse in ubuntu?
2007-10-11T09:58:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,extra buttons as far as what? side buttons?
2007-10-11T09:58:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,yes
2007-10-11T09:58:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"i used to i think in gentoo, but i dont remember how to do it"
2007-10-11T09:59:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"it seems to be a reall pain in the ass, i tried for a while but gave up"
2007-10-11T09:59:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,thats only if he has a processor that supports cpu scaling...
2007-10-11T10:02:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"lol i actually booted Vista today, wouldnt load my wireless card driver, searched on the manufacturer website, it said vista should work with no additonal drivers...i said okay well thats enough vista for 3 weeks, back to ubuntu ;p"
2007-10-11T10:03:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"it does startup a hell of a lot faster than XP, otherwise not much improvement really"
2007-10-11T10:24:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,ever tried to use a prefetching type app in ubuntu?
2007-10-11T10:24:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,not really
2007-10-11T10:25:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"ts a good idea, but seems not to be very well developed"
2007-10-11T10:27:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"right, and also preloading programs at boot-time"
2007-10-11T10:27:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,i would love that for firefox lol
2007-10-11T10:28:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,exactly what i was thinking
2007-10-11T10:28:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,i defiitely use firefox the most of any app
2007-10-11T10:28:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"yep, tho xchat starts pretty damn quick anyway"
2007-10-11T10:29:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"my wine takes like 5-10 minutes to start every time, its a pain in the arse, i forget all about trying to start a wine program before it opens lol"
2007-10-11T10:30:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"wine is always slow, i think thats cuz its wine..."
2007-10-11T10:30:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,but never this slow
2007-10-11T10:31:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"im gonna try it out, you might also: 'sudo apt-get install preload'"
2007-10-11T10:38:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"so what do u think? seems pretty straightforward, but not much documentation for it..."
2007-10-11T10:38:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,what do i do? just run it?
2007-10-11T10:38:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"itsa a daemon,so after doing apt-get, u got 'preload started' output?"
2007-10-12T09:14:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,hi hi
2007-10-12T09:20:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"im gonna have to agree with massey on the gimp, find it irrtating coming from photoshop"
2007-10-12T09:24:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,kvm?
2007-10-12T09:25:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,is that a replacement for vmware ?
2007-10-12T09:26:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"qemu is the actual program, kvm is a kernel module that makes it run smoother"
2007-10-12T09:27:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,what would u recommend for running winxp?
2007-10-12T09:27:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,virtualbox
2007-10-12T09:28:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"sweet, i think im going to try that, running photoshop thru wine makes me want to throw things"
2007-10-12T09:28:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,i hear ya there haha
2007-10-12T09:30:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,ahh whats the package name for virtualbox
2007-10-12T09:31:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,isnt it virtualbox?
2007-10-12T09:32:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"is there a way to have vbox use an existing windows installation, like a 'thin' installation sorta"
2007-10-12T09:33:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"i think u can use a physical partition, it may mess with trying to boot that partition later tho"
2007-10-12T09:34:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"its easy to do, but not really smart"
2007-10-12T09:34:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,why noot?
2007-10-12T09:34:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"bqmassey when the vm loads it, its different hardware that windows sees, therefore it needs to load different drivers and such each time, and we all know how windows deals with change"
2007-10-12T09:35:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"yea that does sound like a nightmare, it could then screw up booting the actual windows partition?"
2007-10-12T09:41:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"no probably not, but if u have an xp disc, i can give u a key..."
2007-10-12T09:41:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,oh i can get hacked keys no problem lol
2007-10-12T09:49:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"i dunno either, they aggressively promote it, ever read the pclos magazine?"
2007-10-12T09:51:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"i read one issue, the first article was all this BS about how this guy gave PCLOS, Ubuntu and like Mandriva to a bunch of 'newbies' and they all said they liked pclos and ubuntu was too hard lol"
2007-10-12T10:04:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,thats most definitely wired ... 10/100
2007-10-12T09:31:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,howd it go?
2007-10-12T09:34:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,what do u do just curious
2007-10-12T09:34:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"nothing, im going to college :)"
2007-10-12T09:35:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,nice
2007-10-12T09:35:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,computer engineering...tough major
2007-10-12T09:35:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,ooh yea i bet
2007-10-12T09:40:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,ur runnin 64-bit?
2007-10-12T09:40:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,yep
2007-10-12T09:40:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,did u try the 32-bit first?
2007-10-12T09:40:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,ive used ubuntu since 4.10 (first release) so yea ive used 32 bit
2007-10-12T09:41:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,when/why did u decide to jump to 64?
2007-10-12T09:41:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,when i got a 64 bit processor :)
2007-10-12T09:41:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"lol...ive had one for a while, its an intel tho so its not displayed on the box everywhere"
2007-10-12T09:42:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"but ive heard varying opinions about 64-bit ubuntu, some say dont bother, others say how could u not?!?"
2007-10-12T09:42:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"its personal preference, why wouldnt you though, get the most out of the hardware i guess"
2007-10-12T09:43:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"well besides the obvious issues (flash/java) whcih i know can be worked around, there's a lot of other more obscure things i think i'd run into, like Wine for instance, no 64-bit version rite?"
2007-10-12T09:44:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"no 64 bit version of wine, but u can run the 32 bit, and if u think about it, u wouldnt want a 64 bit version of wine, because it would be like using x64 windows, which i dont know how good that is"
2007-10-12T09:45:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"i see, so how hard is it to run 32-bit apps? or is it just a matter of simply running it in 32-bit mode...rather than trying to force it to 64...and theres no real problems?"
2007-10-12T09:45:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,you run them just as you would any other program
2007-10-12T09:45:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,really? so any app that doesnt have 64-bit version will run in 32-bit mode no prob?
2007-10-12T09:47:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,and it worked fine? why do i keep hearing that 64-bit isnt 'ready' for desktop use yet
2007-10-12T09:47:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"runs fine, just perfect :)"
2007-10-12T09:48:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"bah...methinks i must do 64-bit, but just to make sure, when u have a 32bit app, what do u have to do specifically to run it in 32bit mode?"
2007-10-12T09:49:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"nothing, they just run"
2007-10-12T09:49:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"but you dont want to install a bunch of 32 bit apps, kinda defeats the purpose of running 64 bit os"
2007-10-12T09:50:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"well of course, anything that had 64bit version id use the 64...but i know not everything does"
2007-10-12T09:50:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"yea, but you shouldnt have problems loading 32 bit apps in 64"
2007-10-12T09:50:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"interesting, and u were able to hack the flash/java plugins to ur 64bit firefox?"
2007-10-12T09:51:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,yea they run fine
2007-10-12T09:51:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"well ubotu doesnt apparently know about it, but its nspluginwrapper"
2007-10-12T09:52:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"interesting, u running gutsy too?"
2007-10-12T09:52:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,yes
2007-10-12T09:54:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"okay im going to grab the 64-bit gutsy image, last time i tried i couldnt boot to a gui with the 64 livecd so that kinda put me off the 64 thing"
2007-10-12T09:55:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,good luck :)
2007-10-12T09:55:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"but i have since upgraded my graphics card to nvidia, so im hoping things will be different"
2007-10-12T10:02:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"what do u think, 7.10-rc-alternate-amd64 or 7.10-rc-desktop-amd64 ?"
2007-10-12T10:02:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,id go desktop and if it doesnt work use the alternate
2007-10-12T10:02:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,i prefer alternate install but the desktop one will let me know initially about hardware support
2007-10-12T10:03:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,gotcha
2007-10-12T10:12:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"im gonna have to disagree somewhat with you on that, compizfusion while mostly eyecandy, DOES give added functionality and features for accessibility"
2007-10-12T10:14:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"there are a whole buncha other things tho, in particular the zoom plug-in, helpful for ppl with vision problems obviously, but also quite useful if im on my bed with wireless keyboard"
2007-10-12T10:15:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,vista's visual effects are SAD compared to compiz
2007-10-12T10:16:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"well some ppl have hard time with it, i did too with ATI card, i got an nvidia card and have had 0 problems"
2007-10-12T10:37:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,u know a way to get xchat to bind a key to insert the nick of the last person u talked to? i know Konversation can do this
2007-10-12T10:37:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,no idea
2007-10-12T10:39:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,lates ;p
2007-10-15T11:23:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,i think u want to probe the module called thermal
2007-10-15T11:32:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,start compiling! itll go up! :)
2007-10-15T11:32:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,but even at bios its usually idling at 55C
2007-10-15T11:32:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"according to the bios, but i imagine thats correct..."
2007-10-15T11:32:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"well i figured there was something wrong, that seemed kinda low"
2007-10-15T11:35:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,what about this coretemp module? how do i get output of that?
2007-10-15T11:36:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"oh darn, okay, really wanted to see what difference is beteween toothpaste and arctic silver ;p"
2007-10-19T07:29:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,hey man
2007-10-19T07:30:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,oh ya ;p 7.10 x64 :)
2007-10-19T07:30:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,that realtime kernel is worth it
2007-10-19T07:31:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,is it now? are u talking about the Ubuntu kernel or a vanilla kernel?
2007-10-19T07:31:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"well im using the vanilla kernel, but the ubuntu one im sure just has lowlatency"
2007-10-19T07:32:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"well i know feisty had a 'lowlatency' version, and i thot gutsy had a newly named 'realtime' version similar, but i havent investigated..."
2007-10-19T07:37:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,have u had any problems with flash on gutsy 64? cuz i havent so far...
2007-10-19T07:37:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,too bad nspluginwrapper wont work with jave....
2007-10-19T07:37:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"ahh yes, how did u handle the java issue btw?"
2007-10-19T07:38:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"nothing so far, i havent really come across anything i need java for, if theres something i absolutely need it for i can use a vm i suppose, im ont going to install firefox 32bit"
2007-10-19T07:39:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,yea i havent really needed java yet so far...but i imagine i'll need it at some point....i thot there was a way to deal with it
2007-10-19T07:39:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,nothin really except for installing 32 bit firefox
2007-10-19T07:40:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,really? thats shitty
2007-10-19T07:58:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,u seen this article? seems interesting...http://www.bit-tech.net/bits/2007/10/16/64-bit_more_than_just_the_ram/1
2007-10-19T09:39:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"so u finally built your own custom kernel that works? I finally concluded that it wasnt worth the effort, only thing i wanted really was the realtime version i think"
2007-10-19T09:40:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"i think it was worth it, optimized for my processor instead of generic x86_64 its amd64 now"
2007-10-19T09:40:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,humm...but i thot ubuntu automatically installed the correct kernel for your architecture...
2007-10-19T09:41:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,as evidenced by uname -a 'Linux ubuntu64 2.6.22-14-generic #1 SMP Sun Oct 14 21:45:15 GMT 2007 x86_64 GNU/Linux'
2007-10-19T09:42:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"Linux dp-lappy 2.6.23.1-dp #1 SMP PREEMPT Mon Oct 15 21:17:16 CDT 2007 x86_64 GNU/Linux   it says x86_64, but its set in the config for my amd k8 family processor, more optimized than generic x86_64 i believe"
2007-10-19T09:43:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"hm, interesting...whats the preempt mean?"
2007-10-19T09:45:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"ah cool, i think im goign to just get the lowlatency kernel meta package thing"
2007-10-19T09:45:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"you can also change the timer frequency of your processor, i bumped mine up to 1000hz which is apparently the best choice for systems requiring fast interactive responses to events"
2007-10-19T09:46:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,no kidding...u did that during setup-xconfig ? my question then is who wouldnt want fast interactive responses to events ??
2007-10-19T09:47:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"i dont know why for sure some of those things arent enabled by default, but i guess its because some processors cant handle it and you would want the config that the most machines would support"
2007-10-19T09:48:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,yea i spose that makes sense....can you really 'feel' it tho? or could it just be psychological? i want to see proof of this lol
2007-10-19T09:49:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,it boots much faster than it did on the generic 2.6.22
2007-10-19T09:49:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,really? it boots faster huh...well i spose that might be because its not loading all those modules maybe?
2007-10-19T09:50:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"well, i didnt mess with the modules yet, i figure i can do that anytime, i wanted to get the processor optimized first"
2007-10-19T09:51:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,oh...but i dont see how processor optimization would really affect boot times...
2007-10-19T09:52:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"who knows, but it is definitely faster"
2007-10-19T09:54:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"yea....i dunno, it is enticing but it sounds like it could be headaches...not to mention taking a couple hours to compile.."
2007-10-19T09:54:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"it takes 45 minutes to an hour, but theres no real headaches if u follow the guide i used, youd have to recompile any extra drivers you had tho (nvidia, etc.)"
2007-10-19T09:56:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,got a link to that guide by chance?
2007-10-19T09:58:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,http://www.howtoforge.com/kernel_compilation_ubuntu
2007-10-19T10:02:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"on that page is the first step at all required, section 1.1"
2007-10-19T10:02:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,oh...maybe i shouldnt do this tonight...i'll never get anywhere with apt-get...
2007-10-19T10:03:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,u should start it compiling tonight and it will be ready in the morning :)
2007-10-19T10:04:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,well that was my plan...but im afraid if i have to grab packages from apt .... might take all night just to do that with the servers being hammered
2007-10-19T10:05:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"no, i upgraded to RC1 64 last week"
2007-10-19T10:05:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"i should say, i clean-installed to new partition"
2007-10-19T10:06:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"ic, i did that with the rc as well, then kept up-to-date until it stopped giving updates a few days ago"
2007-10-19T10:06:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"it was givin me updates yesterday, but nothing today, i assumed because of all the traffic"
2007-10-19T10:08:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,this article is a decent read: http://www.bit-tech.net/bits/2007/10/16/64-bit_more_than_just_the_ram/1
2007-10-19T10:09:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,lol yeh
2007-10-19T10:09:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,can u post your uname -a output again
2007-10-19T10:10:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,Linux dp-lappy 2.6.23.1-dp #1 SMP PREEMPT Mon Oct 15 21:17:16 CDT 2007 x86_64 GNU/Linux
2007-10-19T10:11:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,this the one i want? http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/patch-2.6.23.1.bz2
2007-10-19T10:11:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"thats the one i used, newest one i believe"
2007-10-19T10:11:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,no? which one do i want then lol? http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/

2007-10-19T10:12:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,isnt that what i just said?
2007-10-19T10:12:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"oh, i linked to the Patch...gotcha"
2007-10-19T10:13:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"no, yours was the patch, that was the actual kernel"
2007-10-19T10:13:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"ic ic, is the realtime thing a patch i gotta add?"
2007-10-19T10:14:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"no, just an option you set in the config, its actually low-latency, btw are you using an amd64 chip?"
2007-10-19T10:14:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,no im using Pentium D 2.8ghz @ ~3.4ghz
2007-10-19T10:21:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"lol, thats pretty harsh ;p"
2007-10-19T10:24:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,dont u think that guide u gave me is a little old? 6.10? or do u think its fine?
2007-10-19T10:24:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"its the one i followed, works just fine, makes deb packages for the kernel and headers, and when u install them it adds entries to grub"
2007-10-19T10:25:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"cool cool, was just wonderin about step 1.1"
2007-10-19T10:25:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"yea dont worry about that one, i didnt do it, everything else shold be fine, skip the patches thing unless you are patching your kernel, which i doubt u are"
2007-10-19T10:26:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,yea im all set with patching
2007-10-19T10:37:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,compiling yet?! =)
2007-10-19T10:37:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"lol...no, stuck on step 3.../usr/src/linux folder doesnt exist...?"
2007-10-19T10:38:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"its a symlink, did you extract the kernel source to /usr/src?"
2007-10-19T10:38:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,all u gotta do is: ln -s /usr/src/linux-2.6.23.1 /usr/src/linux
2007-10-19T10:38:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,i extracted it to ~/
2007-10-19T10:38:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,move it to /usr/src
2007-10-19T10:38:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,kk
2007-10-19T10:38:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,then do that ln -s command
2007-10-19T10:45:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"hmm the make menuconfig has a lottttaa options, maybe i should just mess with this tomorow..."
2007-10-19T10:46:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,i just messed with the Processor Types and Features part
2007-10-19T10:46:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,haha i see
2007-10-19T10:46:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,you can go back and recompile again any time
2007-10-19T10:46:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"youll always have the config, and you can go back and trim out modules that you dont want"
2007-10-19T10:52:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"k im setting 3 options, processor type to p4..the 1000hz thing, and the Preemptible Kernel (low-latency desktop) option"
2007-10-19T10:52:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"sweet, good luck :)"
2007-10-19T10:52:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,u did remember to load your previous config right?
2007-10-19T10:53:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,yea...pretty sure i did that right...
2007-10-19T10:53:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,the worst that can happen is it doesnt compile and u have to try again lol
2007-10-19T10:53:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,kk
2007-10-19T11:07:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"okay im compiling...gonna hit the sakc, thx for ur help"
2007-10-22T06:13:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,whatsup shrek
2007-10-22T06:14:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"I got it compiled, tried booting with it, nothing worked properly, screen was in 'low res' mode, no sound, nothing....i think i messed up the part of copying my current config over"
2007-10-22T06:15:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,you maybe forgot to load the configuration during the menuconfig
2007-10-22T06:15:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"i didnt forget to do that, but i may have put the .config file in the wrong dir or copied or incorrectly"
2007-10-22T06:16:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"when radioaktivstorm comes back and is looking for me, tell em ill brb k?"
2007-10-22T06:17:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,alright
2007-10-22T06:29:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"hey i wanna trim out the 'fat' from the kernel this time before i compile it, it seems to be compiling a shitload of modules that i obviously dont need"
2007-10-22T06:29:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"thats true, i was going to do that too, but im kinda lazy"
2007-10-22T06:29:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,well lets do it then ;P
2007-10-22T06:30:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"alright, ill start lookin through, make sure u type lsmod and make sure you include those modules in your kernel"
2007-10-22T06:30:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,kk
2007-10-22T06:31:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,is there a way i can tell that im using my current kernel config when im runing make menuconfig?
2007-10-22T06:31:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"well, your going to want to copy the latest config from /boot to your kernel source directory and call the file .config, then load it when u get into the menuconfig"
2007-10-22T06:32:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"i know and thats what i did, but i dthink i miessed that part up somehow last time, how do i check if its actually the right .config file from my current config?"
2007-10-22T06:33:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"its not really possible, you just kinda gotta assume that it is, if u copy the config from your currently running kernel, it should be right"
2007-10-22T06:34:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,well the only thing i can conclude is that i messed that step up because the kernel didnt boot like a ubuntu kernel should...lotta my hardware was not working
2007-10-22T06:35:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"thats what you were saying, did u run the compile command just like it was on that tutorial? it needs the initramfs flag so it loads drivers at boot"
2007-10-22T06:35:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"pretty sure, maybe thats wht i messed up, i dunno ;p"
2007-10-22T06:36:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"anyways, see if u can figure out how to trim the kernel down so compiling doesnt take so long this time ;p"
2007-10-22T06:37:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"well i know how, its just kinda a long process of going through all the submenus and disabling drivers, and its kinda pointless to do it now, ill just wait until i wanna upgrade my kernel again, and i may not even do it then lol, the only thing thats bad is it will take long to compile, its not going to make your computer run any faster to disable all that stuff because they are just modules and arent even being loaded any"
2007-10-22T06:38:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"hmm, okay, but there are also about 8000 other options in there, there must be some more ways to optimize it beyond setting your processor type and the realtime thing"
2007-10-22T06:39:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"also do u think it's worth it to try and add in the restricted drivers, only one i need is nvidia"
2007-10-22T06:40:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"u cant really add that because you dont have the source code for it, youll just have to recompile it upon booting the new kernel"
2007-10-22T06:40:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,ah but the ubuntu kernel guide does mention adding restricted drivers module
2007-10-22T06:41:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"hmm, i never tried it"
2007-10-22T07:07:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,no i didnt really setup anything i dont recall...i havent it installed it yet on gutsy cuz i thot gutsy had its 'prefetch' thingy
2007-10-22T07:08:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"there's a way to output its logfile, and it will tell u if it has anything cached, when i was running it, it would sometimes tell me it had cached a few things"
2007-10-22T09:53:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,rm -r
2007-10-22T09:54:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,rm -r /path/to/dir/ ?
2007-10-22T09:55:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,im deleting my linux-2.6.23.1/ dir from /usr/src so i can make sure i have a fresh start...
2007-10-22T09:55:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,you could just run: make clean
2007-10-22T09:55:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,well too late now ;p
2007-10-22T10:00:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,perhaps my last try wasnt successful because the vanilla kernel was lacking some of the patches that would be in a ubuntu kernel?
2007-10-22T10:10:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,networking using a vista guest is apparently broken in virtualbox
2007-10-22T10:11:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,even with the VBoxGuestAdditions vista doesnt work?
2007-10-22T10:11:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"no, vista wont detect any networking device at all..."
2007-10-22T10:12:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,i didnt set a single option in vbox for my networking
2007-10-22T10:12:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,thats cuz vista sucks lol
2007-10-22T10:12:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,under the machine settings...under network ...
2007-10-22T10:18:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,nite
2007-10-26T05:06:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"dream_coder, debs and rpms for for noobs, source code!"
2007-10-26T08:23:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,whatup meng ;p
2007-10-26T08:23:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,yes! finally today i got nvidia drivers working

2007-10-26T08:24:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,awesome! :)
2007-10-26T08:25:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"i dont know how i fixed it either, it was all b0rked, even on my old kernel when i tried to install it"
2007-10-26T08:25:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"that happens to me from time to time, never really konw how things get fixed but they do"
2007-10-26T08:26:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,have u had any stability issues with ur kernel? mines pretty stable altho a game crashed on me earlier today...just concerned about the pre-emptible part...dont see many ppl recomending it
2007-10-26T08:27:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,i havent had a single problem yet
2007-10-26T08:27:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"yea...well its runnin pretty good, maybe just a fluke, it was with et:quake wars, did u try that btw?"
2007-10-26T08:27:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"havent yet, the demo thing i downloaded was an exe, so im going to have to look for the iso of it, btw IS it an iso?"
2007-10-26T08:28:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"lol no, they just released the linux native version of it...its a bash installer"
2007-10-26T08:28:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"well i got that, but it asks me to insert a cd or something, i didnt have one though, maybe i got the wrong installer or something"
2007-10-26T08:29:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"its based on the quake4 engine, quake4 is linux-native as well"
2007-10-26T08:29:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"u probly got the full game, u want the demo..."
2007-10-26T08:29:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"damn...ill look into it, but i dont game much on my pc, i use my psp for that :)"
2007-11-06T08:32:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"i feel like slackware is kinda behind the times with their release schedule, they just finally moved to 2.6 kernel? lol"
2007-11-06T08:33:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"theyve had a 2.6 kernel for a long time, it jsut wasnt default, very easy to install though, their software isnt behind the times anymore really"
2007-11-06T08:33:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"i used slackware many years ago, back then it was the best, but i dont think so anyore"
2007-11-06T09:01:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,still running a custom kernel?
2007-11-06T09:02:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,yeap
2007-11-06T09:02:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,its runnin just fine
2007-11-06T09:03:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,was workin on compiling 2.6.23-mm kernel
2007-11-06T09:03:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,haha nice
2007-11-06T09:04:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,anything interesting in there? ive never used git before ;p
2007-11-06T09:04:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"b43 driver, supposed to replace bcm43xx i guess"
2007-11-06T09:04:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"ah, well any added wireless functionality is a welcome change"
2007-11-06T09:05:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,i want them to merge the ra2x00 drivers
2007-11-06T09:06:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"yea, well i fixed that problem by just swapping my wifi card like i told u ;p"
2007-11-06T09:07:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"yea well has driver built into kernel, its an older cisco aironet card, only 802.11b but i don care"
2007-11-06T09:08:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"yep, 11mbps is fine for me"
2007-11-06T09:08:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,u ever tried the -mm patch?
2007-11-06T09:08:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,i dont think so
2007-11-06T09:10:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,anything special in the -mm?
2007-11-06T09:11:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,there's a LOT of (NEW) and (EXPERIMENTAL) stuff in it from what ive looked at
2007-11-06T09:11:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,ill take a look as i was just about to compile 2.6.23.1 once again...
2007-11-06T09:11:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"supports reiser4, which is why i grabbed it, but it has some interesting performance options under processor section"
2007-11-06T09:12:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"i was curious tho, i patched mine against 2.6.23, i thot thats what u were sposed to do if u were gonna patch, rather than use 2.6.23.1 (since its already patched??)"
2007-11-06T09:12:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"maybe, i dont konw for sure"
2007-11-06T09:13:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,that confused me
2007-11-06T09:13:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"but about kernels in general, isnt the .1 the patch level?"
2007-11-06T09:13:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,yes
2007-11-06T09:14:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"right, so therefore ur sposed to use the baselevel 2.6.23 if ur gona patch it? i dunno"
2007-11-06T09:15:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"not necessarily, im sure the -mm would patch against the .1 just fine, but i may be wrong, im not a kernel guru :P"
2007-11-06T09:15:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,yea me either ;p
2007-11-06T09:15:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"well u should try -mm patch, its right there on front page of kernel.org so it must be fairly good"
2007-11-06T09:16:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"lol, 'if its there, it must be good'"
2007-11-06T09:16:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"well okay, but i mean, its in common use is what i meant"
2007-11-06T09:16:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,ill give it a go :) gonna patch it against 2.6.23.1
2007-11-06T09:16:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"ok, good idea, i'll try against 2.6.23"
2007-11-06T09:24:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,dyndns is for different purpose i think
2007-11-06T09:24:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"yea, opendns is for a dns server right?"
2007-11-06T09:25:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,its free dns servers u can use instead of your ip's to resolve hostnames
2007-11-06T09:25:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,*isp's
2007-11-06T09:25:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,yes dyndns is that too
2007-11-06T09:44:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,yea thats what i heard too
2007-11-06T09:28:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,did u use patch -p1 ?
2007-11-06T09:29:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,yea
2007-11-06T09:29:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"ok, i never know what -p option to put :P"
2007-11-06T09:29:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,bzcat | blah blah patch -p1
2007-11-06T09:29:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,i donno what it does either ;p
2007-11-06T09:34:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"its whining at me, wont make :("
2007-11-06T09:34:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"oh ya i had that problem, its just the mm patch"
2007-11-06T09:35:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,what u gotta do is edit the Makefile and find where it says Arch ?=
2007-11-06T09:35:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"yea i noticed, how can i compile if it wont make? =P"
2007-11-06T09:36:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"and then put in $(SUBARCH), so it will look like this:   ARCH  ?= $(SUBARCH)"
2007-11-06T09:36:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,he just forgot to specify the arch directory i read
2007-11-06T09:38:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"im confused on that arch thing, should i set the environment variable SUBARCH to something or what?"
2007-11-06T09:39:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,edit the Makefile so that the line: ARCH looks like this:   ARCH  ?= $(SUBARCH)
2007-11-06T09:42:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,compiling now... :)
2007-11-06T09:42:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,lol that was quick...did u check out any of the options?
2007-11-06T09:42:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"the tickless kernel thing looks kinda neat, better power use, but only good for laptops so i didnt use"
2007-11-06T09:43:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,not sure about the 2nd option
2007-11-06T09:43:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"yea i read about that for 24, but i also read that it doesnt make THAT much of a difference"
2007-11-06T09:45:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"apparently it helps a lot for VM's tho, reduces their cpu load when idle"
2007-11-06T09:45:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,brb rebooting
2007-11-06T09:46:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"ic, i dont use vms much, but ill have to enable it when i go through this thing again, i gota ll day off tomorrow, gonna go through and trim this kernel down to the bare essentials"
2007-11-06T09:48:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"bahh this is annoying, i can connect to irc but i cant seem to load any websites..."
2007-11-06T09:49:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,just sits there saying connecting to ubuntuforums.org...
2007-11-06T09:49:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"thats too bad, i hate that when i compile a new kernel and it doenst work right, such a waste of time"
2007-11-06T09:50:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,no thats not why i havent even compiled that yet...only thing i did was move my computer to a different house ... different wireless network
2007-11-06T09:52:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,in /etc/hosts you can set that
2007-11-06T11:42:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,u get that mm kernel compiled?
2007-11-20T08:49:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,aint seen u in a while where ya been?
2007-11-20T08:48:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,hey a
2007-11-20T08:49:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"here and there, busy with school n deer hunting"
2007-11-20T08:49:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"lol, deer hunting...where are u from"
2007-11-20T08:50:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"ah, we got that big out here, im from new hampshire"
2007-11-20T08:50:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"im not running ubuntu anymore, im back on slamd64"
2007-11-20T08:51:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,whatever for?
2007-11-20T08:52:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"i dunno, i just seem to feel more comfortable in a slackware environment, i dont like all the automation that ubuntu has, and just little things here and there that i am used to i spose"
2007-11-20T08:56:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,why slamd64 tho? if i do end up switching distros i think i'd go to Arch
2007-11-20T08:57:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"i dunno, im used to it i guess, i like slackware alot, and slamd64 is slackware ported to x86_64"
2007-11-20T08:57:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"oh i see, makes sense"
2007-11-20T08:58:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,no he's talkin about the bigmem kernel option
2007-11-20T08:58:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"its only in recent 32-bit kernels, its a hack to get up to 4GB of memory"
2007-11-20T09:05:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,u know what file controls loading of modules on startup?
2007-11-20T09:06:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,umm...not exactly sure in ubuntu....something in /etc/modprobe.d/ iirc
2007-11-20T09:06:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,there's a bunch of files in /etc/modprobe.d   wish there was just one....
2007-11-20T09:07:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"things liek that pissed me off lol, didnt feel like figuring out, in slack its all in /etc/rc.d"
2007-11-20T09:07:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"yea, i hear ya"
2007-11-20T09:07:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"i rlly wanna try Arch, but im afraid to undertake such a task as switching distros right now"
2007-11-20T09:08:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,why arch?
2007-11-20T09:08:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"you shold go with a REAL distribution, like slackware :)"
2007-11-20T09:08:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"its got some really good reviews, and it sounds like an 'advanced' linux distro, but not as technical as slack"
2007-11-20T09:09:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,slackware appears to be lacking a package manager that solves dependencies
2007-11-20T09:09:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,that is true
2007-11-20T09:09:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"thing is, ubuntu has a really big community that i like a lot, thats a main reason for me not to switch"
2007-11-20T09:10:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"yea thats true, good for learning, you are relativly new to linux right?"
2007-11-20T09:10:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,tho i do feel like a distro that wasnt so bloated like Arch is right for me
2007-11-20T09:10:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"I am relatively new, 6months at most"
2007-11-20T09:10:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,tho i've been learning pretty quick
2007-11-20T09:12:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"yea, well i learned starting with ubuntu on 4.10 (warty) used ubuntu until breezy or so, then slack, some gentoo, now i just go back and forth, the more time i spend in linux the more i realize that most distros are pretty much the same, aside from where some files are located, and package management"
2007-11-20T09:13:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"true...but isnt it kind of a pain to switch distros? i mean i do have my /home on seperate partition, also have /boot now...but still, takes a lotta work to get back to where u were"
2007-11-20T09:17:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,tried compiling 2.6.24-rc3?
2007-11-20T09:17:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,lol no ;p
2007-11-20T09:18:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,i just actually recompiled 2.6.23.1 with softraid support compiled in
2007-11-20T09:18:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"im compiling now, running rc2 right now"
2007-11-20T09:18:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,anything exciting in the changelog? ;p
2007-11-20T09:18:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"nothing too spectacular, you know 2.6.23.8 is out right? they went from .2 to .8 in like 2 hours lol"
2007-11-20T09:19:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,wtf? no...i didnt even no .2 was out
2007-11-20T09:19:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,holy crap ur right
2007-11-20T09:19:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"damnit, i just recompiled .1 about an hour ago"
2007-11-20T09:20:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"last friday, they had 2.6.23.2, at like 11am, and when i came back at like 2pm it was up to .8 lol"
2007-11-20T09:20:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,welcome to my life lol
2007-11-20T09:21:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"lol, so like, are u testing out any features of .24 or ?"
2007-11-20T09:22:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"not so much, my broadcom wireless card took a shit, otherwise id be trying the b43 driver, apparently my sd card reader in my laptop works now, ill have to see here in a minute, but other than that not much really..."
2007-11-20T09:22:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"the -mm patch has lots of experimental stuff in it, i compiled it once but couldnt get it to run"
2007-11-20T09:22:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,i wanted to try Reiser4 ;P
2007-11-20T09:23:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"thats whay u were saying, reiser4 eh?"
2007-11-20T09:23:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,yea lol
2007-11-20T09:23:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,ext4 is in .23.1 i believe...
2007-11-20T09:23:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"ext4 doesnt seem to offer much, just some more security options....nothin in terms of performance from what ive read"
2007-11-20T09:24:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"thats what i read as well, not really a desktop fs either, more for servers i guess"
2007-11-20T09:29:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,i found this review rather convincing for ArchLinux
2007-11-20T09:30:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,http://usalug.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=10256
2007-11-20T09:30:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,tho i spose it may be rather biasd
2007-11-20T09:31:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,or actually check this page out: http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_vs_Others
2007-11-20T09:33:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"yea, i dont see how dependancy checking is not a problem for you..."
2007-11-20T09:34:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,also the i686 optimization i find appealing
2007-11-20T09:34:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"heh, if i need a dependency, i get it"
2007-11-20T09:34:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,ur running 64 bit anyways right?
2007-11-20T09:34:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,true..
2007-11-20T09:34:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,i guess tahts a moot point then..
2007-11-20T09:35:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,but isnt x86_64 just an i686 architecture with added amd64 instruction set?
2007-11-20T09:35:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"i mean, on the 32-bit side, they're the same"
2007-11-20T09:35:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"i dunno for sure, sounds right lol"
2007-11-20T09:37:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,thats my understanding...but i may be wrong
2007-11-20T09:37:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"im downloading arch right now, gonna install on a vm, ill let u know if i approve =P"
2007-11-20T09:38:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,i think i will install it as a vm along with you
2007-11-20T09:38:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,going with core or ftp?
2007-11-20T09:39:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"im guessing u will because its a mixing of gentoo, slack, and debian"
2007-11-20T09:39:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,the 'no frills' distros ;p
2007-11-20T09:39:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,core...the ftp package is only 42mb lol
2007-11-20T09:40:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"i spose, heh, well see"
2007-11-20T09:41:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,do u enable VT-x/AMD-V in vbox? i enable it but i donno if its doing any good
2007-11-20T09:41:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"i do, but your processor has to support it, i chose something in my bios for virtualization"
2007-11-20T09:42:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,bahh why cant u just use vbox ;p
2007-11-20T09:42:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"cuz i didnt feel like compiling it, they dont have a slack package"
2007-11-20T09:42:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"i chose support for some virutalization options in kernel config, never saw anything in bios for that"
2007-11-20T09:43:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"it may have something to do with the kernel options too, im not exactly sure"
2007-11-20T09:45:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,okay im at the arch install program
2007-11-20T09:45:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,i'll wait for u
2007-11-20T09:46:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"i got 8 minutes left, my connection is slow"
2007-11-20T09:46:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"ah, what are u on?"
2007-11-20T09:46:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"its a 3 meg connection, but i swear im getting throttled"
2007-11-20T09:46:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,sounds it
2007-11-20T09:51:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,":) im beginning install, gonna use reiserfs ;p"
2007-11-20T09:53:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"so far i like the package selection system, tho i dont think i'd ever bother going thru this huge list"
2007-11-20T09:54:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,booting the iso :)
2007-11-20T09:54:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,in the installer i mean
2007-11-20T09:54:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,but i imagine one could make a very lean system this way
2007-11-20T09:54:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,you can always add more later right?
2007-11-20T09:54:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,exactly!
2007-11-20T09:55:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,tho actually most of these seem rather essential so far
2007-11-20T09:55:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,oh yea
2007-11-20T09:56:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,ncurses ;p
2007-11-20T09:59:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"i dont like how it wants to use a /home partition by default, thats kinda annoying to me already"
2007-11-20T09:59:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,what do u mean? i just did the auto partition
2007-11-20T10:01:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"the partitioner on it makes a /home partition by default, i dont like that"
2007-11-20T10:01:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,oh...well why not? sure wished ubuntu had done that when i first installed it
2007-11-20T10:02:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"oh my lord, now im just at a list of system config files im sposed to edit with Vi lol"
2007-11-20T10:02:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"i dont like to restrict my / partion at all, whenever i make a /home partition i always fill it up"
2007-11-20T10:02:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,think ima wait for u 2 catch up
2007-11-20T10:03:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"im installing base, devel, and lib"
2007-11-20T10:03:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"oh, i install base, lib, support"
2007-11-20T10:03:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,probly shoulda just grabbed ema ll
2007-11-20T10:04:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"ok, i added support"
2007-11-20T10:04:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,installing packages
2007-11-20T10:05:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,oops i think i just started building the system
2007-11-20T10:05:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,lol
2007-11-20T10:05:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,this is gonna be a real clumsy installation
2007-11-20T10:05:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,lol
2007-11-20T10:07:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,my rc3 kernel is ready too :)
2007-11-20T10:07:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,o boy ;p
2007-11-20T10:08:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,im restarting the install lol
2007-11-20T10:08:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,I F'ed it up
2007-11-20T10:11:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,are u at the configure stage?
2007-11-20T10:12:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"its installing packages, step 3 i believe"
2007-11-20T10:12:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,alright
2007-11-20T10:14:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,seen ubuntu-jeos?
2007-11-20T10:14:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,no what is it?
2007-11-20T10:14:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,ubuntu specifically designed to be run as a vm
2007-11-20T10:14:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,no kidding...cool
2007-11-20T10:24:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,lol how do i make a new user in the cmd prompt?
2007-11-20T10:25:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,adduser
2007-11-20T10:27:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,okay what else do i need to provide to useradd?
2007-11-20T10:28:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,maybe adduser  one of them doesnt require parameters and prompts you for everything
2007-11-20T10:29:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"yea that works, thx"
2007-11-20T10:32:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"my install is done, going to reboot to my new kernel also..brb"
2007-11-20T10:48:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,it work?
2007-11-20T10:49:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"not really...its whining about my locale, i dont think i set it up right"
2007-11-20T10:49:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"i didnt feel like editing a bunch of files during the install, and i think its fuxt up"
2007-11-20T10:49:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,me too...i dunno how to install any new packages
2007-11-20T10:49:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,doesnt seem like a very friendly installer
2007-11-20T10:50:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"yea, i run pacman and it says current locale is invalid using default"
2007-11-20T10:50:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"on an unrelated note, do u specify 'vga=xxx' in your kernel boot line in menu.lst ?"
2007-11-20T10:50:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,on my host or guest?
2007-11-20T10:51:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,host
2007-11-20T10:51:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"i use lilo, but i use 791"
2007-11-20T10:51:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,i set it to 773 on the arch install and i get a nice 1024x768 tty...but doesnt seemt o work when i set it on my host config
2007-11-20T10:52:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,mine is widescreen tho
2007-11-20T10:52:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,humm....i got a 1280x1024LCD ... should i try 794? (1280@64k) ?
2007-11-20T10:53:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"its worth a shot, but hard to say if it will work or not"
2007-11-20T10:53:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"i wanna boot without splash, but i'd like to see the boot messages in 1280 res....hard to see at default"
2007-11-20T10:55:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,ive already decided im not too fond of arch
2007-11-20T10:55:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"lol, u dint even give it a shot ;p"
2007-11-20T10:55:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,so far im liking the simplified config files
2007-12-05T11:20:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,whatup meng ;p
2007-12-05T11:21:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"pretty good man, im running Arch now ;)"
2007-12-05T11:21:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,i like it...tho i dont have too much else to compare it to except ubuntu
2007-12-05T11:23:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,u still running slamd64?
2007-12-05T11:25:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"slack is definitely a good distro, but I think u might really like Arch, mostly because of its rolling release system, you're always up to date"
2007-12-05T11:25:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,how does it work? just auto updates all the time or what?
2007-12-05T11:25:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,yea i look forward to running pacman -Syu  everytime i get home from work ;)
2007-12-05T11:26:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"running that synchronizes the repos, any updates get installed, recently we got updates to things like Xorg-server and nautilus"
2007-12-05T11:26:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"heh, i just recently set up a cron job to rsync slamd64-current, so now ill stay up to date too"
2007-12-05T11:27:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,rather than the terribly un-exciting updates that ubuntu delivers ;p
2007-12-05T11:27:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,it uses Pacman
2007-12-05T11:27:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,along with ABS (arch build system) which is similar in concept to BSD's Ports system
2007-12-05T11:28:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"mm, they're neither"
2007-12-05T11:28:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,they come in .pkg.tar.gz format ;p
2007-12-05T11:29:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,but basically they are all built from ABS using Arch-made PKGBUILD files
2007-12-05T11:29:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"the PKGBUILD files are pretty small and just give compiler-flags, location of the source files to download, and any other options"
2007-12-05T11:30:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"and u just makepkg -i with the pkgbuild file and it downloads the source, compiles, and makes a working package for u to use with pacman"
2007-12-05T11:30:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"ic, sounds kinda like slackbuilds, except they dont point to a download site"
2007-12-05T11:30:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,slackbuilds require source files to be local?
2007-12-05T11:30:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,yea i think its a similar concept
2007-12-05T11:31:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,tho honestly i havent even built anything myself yet ;p
2007-12-05T11:31:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"tho with that new flash update, i might try it"
2007-12-05T11:32:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"heh, so when you install soemthign, i has to compile it each time? or your pacman gets precompiled packages?"
2007-12-05T11:32:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,arch gets binary updates
2007-12-05T11:32:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,it is not like gentoo in that respect
2007-12-05T11:45:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,so how is your dependency management going? ;p
2007-12-05T11:46:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"i dont really have any issues, granted a few things i need to compile a dependency for, most things work just fine"
2007-12-05T11:47:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"hehe, yea im just giving u crap ;p"
2007-12-05T11:47:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,are u using RPM's for package installs or no?
2007-12-05T11:48:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"now, slackware packages (.tgz) or source compiling"
2007-12-05T11:48:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,does slack use rpm?
2007-12-05T11:49:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"no, it uses slackware packages which are .tgz"
2007-12-05T11:49:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,oh k
2007-12-05T11:49:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,he should be able to burn that iso using nautilus by default...
2007-12-05T11:50:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"well it is breezy, ubuntu 5.10"
2007-12-05T11:51:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"Oh, i wonder what version of Gnome that is ;p"
2007-12-05T11:58:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,the file:// format is gnome-vfs stuff i believe
2007-12-05T11:58:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,o wait nvm
2007-12-06T10:29:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,whatup meng
2007-12-06T10:30:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"not much, just fixing / tweaking various things"
2007-12-06T10:30:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"u pointed him to broadcom firmwares, i have a different chip but how would i flash the firmware on it?"
2007-12-06T10:31:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"you dont flash the firmware at all, it gets loaded upon boot"
2007-12-06T10:31:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,Aironet (cisco) 802.11b
2007-12-06T10:31:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,uses airo module
2007-12-06T10:43:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"no idea, just wondering whats inside of it =P"
2007-12-06T10:32:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,well it tells me everytime i boot that it can't do WPA and such without version x.x firmware
2007-12-06T10:32:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,i mean i dont need wpa now but itd be nice to have my card upgraded firmware..
2007-12-06T10:33:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,"cisco has a flashing program and the firmwares on their site, but the app only runs in winxp ;("
2007-12-06T10:33:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,okay well what if i have the firmware?

2007-12-06T10:42:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,"hmm, i got no idea how to extract it, wonder if its liek a cd image...you could try mounting it like an iso: mount -o loop"
2007-12-06T10:42:00.000Z,Evanlec,MasterShrek,well i thot that was the file u used to flash
2007-12-06T10:42:00.000Z,MasterShrek,Evanlec,very possible
