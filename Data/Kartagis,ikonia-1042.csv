2008-06-16T15:26:00.000Z,Kartagis,,when I check dmesg
2008-06-16T15:28:00.000Z,Kartagis,,can i get help please?
2008-06-16T15:28:00.000Z,Kartagis,,"I got the error Error inserting wlan_scan_sta (/lib/modules/2.6.24-18-generic/net/wlan_scan_sta.ko): Unknown symbol in module, or unknown parameter (see dmesg) when I did a modprobe wlan_scan_sta"
2008-06-16T15:28:00.000Z,Kartagis,,as described on http://www.ubuntugeek.com/atheros-5007eg-with-madwifi-on-i386-platform.html. any ideas why?
2008-06-16T15:29:00.000Z,Kartagis,,"when I check dmesg, I get http://paste.ubuntu.com/20563/"
2008-06-16T15:29:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"that module either requires a depenant module, or is not compatbile with that kernel"
2008-06-16T15:29:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,where did you get that module
2008-06-16T15:30:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,http://snapshots.madwifi.org/special/madwifi-ng-r2756+ar5007.tar.gz
2008-06-16T15:30:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,looks like that module won't run against your current version
2008-06-16T15:31:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,do a modinfo against it see if it needs a dependant module ?
2008-06-16T15:33:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,http://paste.ubuntu.com/20587/
2008-06-16T15:43:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,can you help me with that?
2008-06-17T17:52:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,got the video codec installed ?
2008-06-17T17:52:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"not sure, how to check?"
2008-06-17T18:04:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,how can I check if I have the codecs? totem plays fine
2008-06-17T18:04:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"then you should have the codecs, is mplayer linked against it"
2008-06-17T18:04:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,how do I check that?
2008-06-17T18:06:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"oh, the other file played well"
2008-08-23T16:07:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,look in the syslog
2008-08-23T16:09:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,/var/log/messages doesn't have an answer
2008-08-23T16:10:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,what does it say about it when it starts up
2008-08-23T16:10:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,rndc: connect failed: 127.0.0.1#953: connection refused
2008-08-23T16:10:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,that can't be everything
2008-08-23T16:11:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,you should see a 'starting bind' message
2008-08-23T16:12:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,/etc/init.d/bind9 start
2008-08-23T16:12:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,look in the syslog
2008-08-23T16:12:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,you should have more info
2008-08-23T16:13:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,or consider passing -d9 as a startup option to gain a LOT of debugging info
2008-08-23T16:18:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,I don't get any messages
2008-08-23T16:18:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,start bind with -d9 options
2008-08-23T16:18:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,is named now running ?
2008-08-23T16:19:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,Kartagis -d 9
2008-08-23T16:20:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"as did I, I just looked at the man page"
2008-08-23T16:20:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,nothing
2008-08-23T16:20:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,how did you install bind
2008-08-23T16:20:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,apt-get install bind9
2008-08-23T16:22:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,/var/log/syslog
2008-08-23T16:23:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,I think this is it. Aug 23 14:20:18 tolga-desktop kernel: [16038.430263] audit(1219490418.061:26): type=1503 operation='inode_create' requested_mask='w::' denied_mask='w::' name='/etc/init.d/named.run' pid=11880 profile='/usr/sbin/named' namespace='default'
2008-08-23T16:24:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,should be more than that
2008-08-23T16:24:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"nope, that's it"
2008-08-23T16:25:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,grep through that syslog for named
2008-08-23T16:25:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,also how did you install bind
2008-08-23T16:25:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"oh, I found things"
2008-08-23T16:25:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,apt-get install bind9
2008-08-23T16:26:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"ok, so thats a good start"
2008-08-23T16:31:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,I found the problem. i just have to fiddle a bit with the .conf
2008-08-23T16:31:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,good
2008-08-23T16:32:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,thanks for pointing me out to syslog. I though it would be messages
2008-08-26T00:54:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,what's the issue
2008-08-26T00:54:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,my hosted domains won't resolve
2008-08-26T00:55:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"ok - so tell me more about the issue, show me your bind config, show me your zone file, show me your resolv.conf, explain what happens when you try to resolve"
2008-08-26T00:55:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,use the pastebin
2008-08-26T00:55:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,and therefore I can't receive any emails
2008-08-26T01:00:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"when I try to resolve, I get connection timed out; no servers could be reached. my files are at http://pastebin.com/f7bca3ce3"
2008-08-26T01:00:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"ok - so the first issue is the dns servers,"
2008-08-26T01:00:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,exactly
2008-08-26T01:01:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"it appears to not be able to contact a dns server, that either means your dns server isn't running - or it is pointing at a non-existant one"
2008-08-26T01:04:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"it should listen to port 953 too, no?"
2008-08-26T01:04:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,key is 53 tcp and udp
2008-08-26T01:05:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,53 tcp/udp is 'bind'
2008-08-26T01:07:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,it stopped by itself. now it doesn't resolve. can you help me? are you looking at my files?
2008-08-26T01:07:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"your files look fine, you may want to consider not using views until you get this working"
2008-08-26T01:08:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,it was working yesterday
2008-08-26T01:09:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"it resolve to my external IP if i keep resolv.conf at 192.168.1.1, and if I change it to 1.2 it doesn't resolve at all"
2008-08-26T01:09:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,if nothing has changed on the server then the only thing that could have changed is a.) the server that is the root server for the domain b.) a firewall
2008-08-26T01:10:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,is listening on .2 ?
2008-08-26T01:10:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,what is the difference between .1 and .2
2008-08-26T01:10:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,is this on a DSL line ?
2008-08-26T01:11:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,yes
2008-08-26T01:11:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,you know that's a really bad idea
2008-08-26T01:11:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,why?
2008-08-26T01:12:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,1.) each domain should have 2 dns servers 2.) the dns servers should be on seperate address ranges and machines 3.) the dns servers should not be on async lines 4.) a lot of ISPS will block network services 5.) home networking is not designed to deal with that
2008-08-26T01:13:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,it used to work well with my previous distribution
2008-08-26T01:13:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,that doesn't change anything I've just said
2008-08-26T01:29:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,how do I stop NetworkManager from modifying my /etc/resolv.conf everytimt I reboot?
2008-08-27T13:08:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,make sure X11 forwarding is enabled on both sides
2008-08-27T13:09:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,both sides? in config you mean?
2008-08-27T13:10:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,yes
2008-09-22T18:09:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,8.05
2008-09-22T18:09:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,what version of ubuntu are you running ?
2008-09-22T18:10:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,what happens if you install mysql-server-5.0
2008-09-22T18:10:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,it says 'already the latest version'. let me re-install
2008-09-22T18:11:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,then you already have mysql-server installed
2008-09-23T17:48:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,it does it automaticlly
2008-09-23T17:49:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,it didn't for sun-java6-jre
2008-09-23T17:49:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,what does it say
2008-09-23T17:51:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,http://paste.ubuntu.com/49668/
2008-09-23T17:52:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,is this on a 64bit machien
2008-09-23T17:52:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"bo, 32"
2008-09-23T17:53:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,first thing to do is run sudo apt-get -f install
2008-09-23T17:53:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,that is the problem 'ia32-sun-java6-bin (= 6-06-0ubuntu1) but it is not installable' the question is why
2008-09-23T17:53:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,i just did that
2008-09-23T17:54:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,is ia32-sun-java6-bin available on 6.06 ? trying installing ia32-sun-java6-bin manually
2008-09-23T17:57:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,apt-get -f install did it all
2008-10-08T18:31:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,autoheader is not installed on your system
2008-10-08T18:32:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis, command not found
2008-10-11T19:36:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,what was on the disk you replaced
2008-10-11T19:36:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,the hard disk didn't contain an OS
2008-10-11T19:36:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,what did it contain
2008-10-11T19:36:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,just my ftp partition
2008-10-11T19:37:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,what mount point
2008-10-11T19:37:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,/home/ftp
2008-10-11T19:38:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"ok, thats good then, so what you need to do is re-install grub to look at the correct partition, as it currently standands it's looking in the wrong place for menu.lst - possibly because your device.map is now wrong that you've removed that disk"
2008-10-11T19:39:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,boot up with the ubuntu livecd and then chroot?
2008-10-11T19:39:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,you don't need to chroot
2008-10-11T19:39:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"boot up from the ubuntu livecd and just re-apply grub, using the grub shell"
2008-10-11T19:40:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,i don't know how to use the grub shell
2008-10-11T19:40:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,it's explained in the !grub factoid you sent yourself
2008-10-11T19:44:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,thanks. i'm trying now
2008-10-11T19:48:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"i typed find /boot/grub/stage1 as the howto instructed, and i got 'Error 15: File not found'. what to do now?"
2008-10-11T19:52:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"i typed find /boot/grub/stage1 as the howto instructed, and i got 'Error 15: File not found'. what to do now?"
2008-10-11T21:10:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,is the router connected to the internet (look at the web status page)
2008-10-11T21:05:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,how are you connecting to the internet
2008-10-11T21:05:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,modem/router
2008-10-11T21:05:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,which one
2008-10-11T21:06:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,usrobotics 9105
2008-10-11T21:06:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,is that a modem or a router
2008-10-11T21:06:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,I assume a modem
2008-10-11T21:06:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,both
2008-10-11T21:06:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,no - it's either a modem or a router
2008-10-11T21:08:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"i get to internet through that and it had a built in firewall which lets me open up ports and route, so it's a modem/router"
2008-10-11T21:08:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,a firewall doesn't make it a router
2008-10-11T21:08:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"does the device authenticate to the internet, or does your desktop authenticate to the internet"
2008-10-11T21:08:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,the device
2008-10-11T21:08:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"ok - so it's a router, not a modem"
2008-10-11T21:09:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"how do you connect to it, ethernet"
2008-10-11T21:09:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"so, how can you help me?"
2008-10-11T21:09:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,respond to my questions
2008-10-11T21:09:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,okay it's a router then
2008-10-11T21:09:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"how do you connect to it, ethernet"
2008-10-11T21:10:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"yes, ethernet"
2008-10-11T21:12:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,i can't make a connection
2008-10-11T21:13:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,then it's a problem with the router - not ubuntu
2008-10-11T21:13:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,this happened after i reinstalled ubuntu
2008-10-11T21:13:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,on the router status page - is it connected to the internet yes/no
2008-10-11T21:14:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,i can't get to the status page
2008-10-11T21:14:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,so your ubuntu machine is not on the network then
2008-10-11T21:14:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,if you do 'ifconfig eth0' does eth0 have an ipaddress assigned
2008-10-11T21:14:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,no
2008-10-11T21:14:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,ok - so thats the problem
2008-10-11T21:14:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,I assume your router is the dhcp server ?
2008-10-11T21:15:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"when i type ifconfig eth0 up, it says ERROR while getting interface flags: No such device"
2008-10-11T21:15:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,I didn't say to do that
2008-10-11T21:16:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,I asked if your router was your dhcp server
2008-10-11T21:16:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"yes, it's dhcp server"
2008-10-11T21:16:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,ok - so if you do 'ifconfig eth0' do you get a response other than 'no such interface'
2008-10-11T21:16:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,nope
2008-10-11T21:16:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,so if you do ifconfig eth0 you get 'no such device'
2008-10-11T21:17:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"when i type ifconfig eth0 up, it says ERROR while getting interface flags: No such device. when I type ifconfig eth0, it says error fetching interface information: Device not found"
2008-10-11T21:18:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,right - so if you do an 'ifconfig -a' what do you see ?
2008-10-11T21:18:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,only lo
2008-10-11T21:18:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"ok - so thats the problem, your network card is not loaded, so ubuntu can't see anything on it"
2008-10-11T21:19:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,what type of card is it
2008-10-11T21:19:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,lspci somehow doesn't show it
2008-10-11T21:20:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,then looks like you may have a hardware error
2008-10-11T21:23:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,did you get the last message about your hardware maybe having a problem
2008-10-11T21:29:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,but this happened after a re-install. and the mouse isn't working either
2008-10-11T21:29:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,it looks like a hardware issue
2008-10-11T21:29:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,maybe the reboot shorted something
2008-10-11T21:29:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,if lspci cant see it
2008-10-11T21:33:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,what about the mouse not working?
2008-10-11T21:33:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"as I said, maybe something is lose, or the motherboard got shorted on a reboot"
2008-10-11T21:33:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"I can understand things not working, but not being listed as hardware means the motherboard can't 'see' it"
2008-10-11T21:52:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,where did you ask for this ?
2008-10-11T21:52:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,at the very start
2008-10-11T21:52:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,start of what ?
2008-10-11T21:52:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,installation
2008-10-11T21:52:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"oh, don't know why then"
2008-10-13T16:14:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,installed other langue packs ?
2008-10-13T16:14:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"no, i thought that was done automatically since it was done so on my laptop"
2008-10-13T16:15:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,don't think so
2008-10-13T16:33:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,I don't believe so
2008-10-13T16:33:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"but I could be wrong on that, I never use that method"
2008-11-03T17:42:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,what do you mean ?
2008-11-03T17:43:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,the certificate needed to connect to our wpa2 connection
2008-11-03T17:43:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,how is the certificate offered ?
2008-11-03T17:43:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,i think in .cer format?
2008-11-03T17:44:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,errrr are you sure thats fore your wireless connection
2008-11-03T17:44:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,let me see
2009-01-07T18:31:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,it will remove anything from the ldap-server meta package
2009-01-07T18:32:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,thanks
2009-01-15T17:04:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"any text editor, or scream maybe"
2009-01-16T14:36:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,when you launch it - it will segfault
2009-01-16T14:36:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,report the output to the developers
2009-03-20T12:49:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,no there is not
2009-04-29T13:14:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"let me ask something. when i boot off livecd, everything will be working right? usb specifically"
2009-04-29T13:15:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"should be unless you need propritary modules, or specific configs"
2009-04-29T13:15:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,i need to recover stuff from a windows laptop
2009-04-29T13:16:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,ok ?
2009-07-06T17:02:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,that is unsupported
2009-07-06T17:02:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,yes
2010-02-03T15:11:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,if you want
2010-02-03T15:12:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,is there an alternative?
2010-04-27T13:38:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,how can I upgrade my libc6 to 16? my version is 15
2010-04-27T13:38:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,why do you want to
2010-04-27T13:38:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,changing libc versions is highly dangerous
2010-04-27T13:39:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,I have a problem with nslookup. netadmin said this could be solved with upgrading libc6
2010-04-27T13:40:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"1.) nslookup is depreciated 2.) changing libc should not be done at all,"
2010-04-27T13:40:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,even dig cannot resolve it
2010-04-27T13:40:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,then it won't be a libc issue
2010-04-27T13:42:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"I take full responsibility, I've to try it"
2010-04-27T13:43:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,what are you trying to resolve ?
2010-04-27T13:43:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,if dig can't resolve it it won't be a libc issue
2010-04-27T13:43:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,what version of ubuntu is this on
2010-04-27T13:43:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,rapidshare and 9.10
2010-04-27T13:44:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,what command are you using that's failing
2010-04-27T13:45:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"when I say what command, exactly what host are you tyring to look up"
2010-04-27T13:45:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=161181 here is the problem
2010-04-27T13:45:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,that's a redhat bug
2010-04-27T13:45:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,don't use that as a reference
2010-04-27T13:46:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,my web browser can't resolve it
2010-04-27T13:46:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"can't resolve what exactly, what host are you trying to resolve exactly"
2010-04-27T13:46:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,rapidshare.com
2010-04-27T13:47:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,ok - I can say for a FACT that is not a libc issue
2010-04-27T13:47:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"I'm using 9.10 and can resolve that fine, and nslookup and dig are not relevant to your web browser"
2010-04-27T13:48:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,netadmin said ubuntu with windows in virtualbox has that issue and it can be resolved by upgrading libc6
2010-04-27T13:49:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,do not do it
2010-04-27T13:49:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,can you resolve any hosts with your webbrowser ?
2010-04-27T13:50:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"other than rapidshare, yes. and my vm can resolve it too"
2010-04-27T13:50:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,ok so the resolver is fine
2010-04-27T13:53:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,I get this nslookup rapidshare.com
2010-04-27T13:53:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,not good
2010-04-27T13:56:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,http://suigeneris.pastebin.com/EEtX6bUg
2010-04-27T13:57:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"yes, a coredump does not look good at all,"
2010-04-27T13:57:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,interesting why it's just that one host
2010-04-27T13:58:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,and the netadmin said this could be solved with upgrading libc
2010-04-27T13:58:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,who is 'the netadmin' ?
2010-04-27T13:58:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,netadmin of our firm
2010-04-27T13:58:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,then ask him to support that
2010-04-27T13:59:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"I take full responsibility, please tell me how to do it"
2010-04-27T13:59:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,speak to your netadmin
2010-04-27T13:59:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"if he thinks that will fix it, he will kow how to do it"
2010-06-22T15:24:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,because you don't mount network devices as vfat
2010-06-22T15:25:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,whether it's linux or windows?
2010-06-22T15:25:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"either way, you don't mount network file systems as vfat, it has to be a network file system such as nfs/samba/cifs"
2010-06-23T16:13:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,there are id3 taggers in the repo
2010-06-23T16:13:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,all will allow you to grab the tag
2010-06-23T16:14:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,I installed mp3info but that works with ID3 1.x ?
2010-06-23T16:14:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,should do
2010-06-23T16:15:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,do you know of one that works with ID3 2.x ?
2010-06-23T16:15:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"most do, check out the descriptions when you search"
2010-07-27T12:28:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"that reminds me, what player would we need?"
2010-07-27T12:29:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,any will work as long as the codecs are supported
2010-07-27T12:32:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,what are the codecs that will support hd movies? or will totem retrieve the codecs automatically?
2010-07-27T12:32:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,they are listed in the DVD section of https://help.ubuntu.com
2010-10-22T22:08:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,pleasea pastebin your sources.list

2010-10-22T22:12:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,why do you have kamric and maverick repos enabled at the same time
2010-10-22T22:13:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,a few days ago I downgraded php
2010-10-22T22:13:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,that is totally unsupported mixing repos your system will now be unstable
2010-10-22T22:14:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,I won't help any futher
2010-10-22T22:14:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,should I delete them?
2010-10-22T22:14:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"too late in my view, damage done"
2010-10-22T22:14:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"but yes, certainly delete them"
2010-11-19T15:21:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,what are you trying to build
2010-11-19T15:21:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,vmware-server
2010-11-19T15:21:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,you need the kernel source package
2010-11-19T15:22:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,what  package exactly?
2010-11-19T15:22:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,the kernel source package for the kernel y ou are running
2010-11-19T15:31:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,I've installed linux-source-2.6.35 but I still get that message
2010-11-19T15:31:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,what message ?
2010-11-19T15:32:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,look in /usr/src - what's there
2010-11-19T15:33:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,http://pastebin.com/ccQBXjPt
2010-11-19T15:33:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,you need a symlink to linux-source-2.6.35 from linux
2011-04-05T13:56:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,domains to what application
2011-04-05T13:57:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,postfix and dovecot
2011-04-05T13:57:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"ok, then it depends how they are setup"
2011-04-06T11:59:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,#postfix
2011-04-06T11:59:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,the main issue appears to be permissions on the file system though
2011-04-06T12:04:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,I suggest you work with one person as the guys in #postfix are also guiding you down a seperate path than noisewaterphd
2011-04-06T12:07:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,you've said that
2011-04-06T12:07:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"now tighten it up - you're going to end up in a mess as you are doing two different things, one from noisewaterphd in here and one from random_guy in #postfix that are differnt"
2011-04-08T15:12:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,are you using virtual users or real system users in
2011-04-08T15:12:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,real
2011-04-08T15:13:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,then you need to change the users home directory in real life
2011-04-08T15:17:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,thanks.
2011-04-08T15:40:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,try logging in as the user outside ftp
2011-04-08T15:42:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,excuse me? what do you mean?
2011-04-08T15:42:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,I mean login to the users account using ssh rather than ftp
2011-04-08T15:45:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"I was able to ssh in, but then that means useradd -p userpass user failed, because I had to do passwd user again"
2011-04-08T15:53:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"I was able to ssh in, but then that means useradd -p userpass user failed, because I had to do passwd user again. could that be possible?"
2011-04-08T16:23:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,do you know what encryption user passwords use?
2011-04-08T16:23:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,sha I think
2011-04-08T16:24:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,just told you the problem
2011-04-08T16:25:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"sorry, not you"
2011-04-08T17:51:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,is the file there
2011-04-08T17:51:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,yes
2011-04-08T17:52:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,show me ls on it

2011-04-08T17:53:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"no, on what it's complaining isn't there"

2011-04-08T17:55:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,don't pastebin the script
2011-04-08T17:55:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,just run the commands manually
2011-04-08T17:55:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,see which one is failing
2011-04-08T17:59:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,there's only one command
2011-04-08T17:59:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,so run the show me the command

2011-06-14T17:03:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,should I get ntpdate?
2011-06-14T17:03:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"that is a one off setting, use ntpd"
2011-06-14T17:04:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,Unable to locate package ntpd
2011-06-14T17:04:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,the package is ntp

2011-06-17T13:29:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,is that anything to do with ubuntu
2011-06-17T13:29:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"ok, so please keep the non-ubuntu stuff out please."
2011-06-23T15:11:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,why would you want to do that ?
2011-06-23T15:12:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,netadmin says 5.8p1 is blocked by IDS
2011-06-23T15:13:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,then you should talk to your netadmin guys as downgrading ssh to a less secure/bug version is backwards instead of updating the netadmin rules
2011-06-23T15:14:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"I don't quite understand. I think if I downgrade to a previous version, the chances of IDS blocking me is slim. why should I talk to netadmin?"
2011-06-23T15:15:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,to get the IDS to not block the better version of SSH
2011-06-23T15:15:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"that's about me I think, not netadmin or IDS"
2011-06-23T15:16:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,what ?
2011-06-23T15:16:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"if your IDS is blocking the new SSH version, update your IDS to not block the newer ssh version, don't downgrade ssh"
2011-06-23T15:17:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,I don't think I can get the netadmin to upgrade IDS
2011-06-23T15:17:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,the chances are next to none
2011-06-23T15:17:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,why ?
2011-06-23T15:17:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,thickheads
2011-06-23T15:17:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,why would someone block the more secure version of SSH - but leave it open for the less secure version
2011-06-23T15:17:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,then you'll need to research package pinning and re-install openssh once the package is pinned
2011-06-23T15:19:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,thanks
2011-06-23T15:57:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"I'm trying package pinning, I've typed sudo apt-get install openssh-server=5.3p1-3ubuntu6 but it says it doesn't have this version. any ideas?"
2011-06-23T15:58:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,does it have that version in the ubuntu version you are using ?
2011-06-23T16:01:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,yes. https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/lucid/+source/openssh/1:5.3p1-3ubuntu6
2011-06-23T16:02:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,I didn't think you where using lucid
2011-06-23T16:03:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,I am using natty. I thought package pinning was done if you want to install an earlier version
2011-06-23T16:03:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"you don't use packages from earlier versions, just an earlier package version within your current distro"
2011-06-23T16:04:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,eg: and earlier natty package for you
2011-06-23T16:04:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,I think natty has only 5.8p1
2011-06-23T16:04:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,can't do it then
2011-06-23T16:07:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,in what section can I see openssh version on http://packages.ubuntu.com
2011-06-23T16:07:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,what ?

2011-06-23T16:12:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,or not use natty
2011-08-14T15:55:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"lucid is an LTS release, natty isn't thats why you've not been notified"
2011-08-14T15:56:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"can you help me with my problem? ubuntu dims the display everytime I start a GUI program with dare background, like terminal"
2011-09-24T13:27:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,are the video cards different
2011-09-24T13:28:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"could be, I'm not sure. can't check now because the one at work is off"
2011-09-24T13:28:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"worth checking,"
2011-09-24T13:29:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,and if they are?
2011-09-24T13:29:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"well, that's where I'd start investigating"
2011-09-24T13:29:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,what codecs can I install here?
2011-09-24T13:30:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,is that the one thats working (I bet not)
2011-09-24T13:31:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,that's the one failing
2011-09-24T13:31:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"SIS video card, terrible, lots of problems. Not surprised it's failing"
2011-09-28T23:51:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,grep $username /etc/passwd and lets see the restuls (it contains no password inforamtion)

2011-09-28T23:52:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"ok, so that's all set spot on, look at the permissions on the home dir as I suspect that's the issue"
2011-09-28T23:53:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"600, maybe that's why?"
2011-09-28T23:53:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,is the user the owner ?
2011-09-28T23:53:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,(and look at the permissions on /srv and /srv/www as the user needs to be able to get into them to see his home dir
2011-09-28T23:53:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,yes
2011-09-28T23:54:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,if you su - $user
2011-09-28T23:54:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,can you then cd into the home dir ?

2011-09-29T00:08:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,are they causing you a problem ?
2011-09-29T00:08:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,I don't to get them
2011-09-29T00:09:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,sorry what ?
2011-09-29T00:09:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,I don't want to get them
2011-09-29T00:09:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,why ? are they causing you problems ?
2011-09-29T00:09:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,they are just warnings
2011-09-29T00:10:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"I didn't receive them before, and I'm afraid they might cause trouble in the future"
2011-09-29T00:10:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"they shouldn't do, hence them being warnings"
2011-09-29T11:15:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"or you could just ignore them, they are just warnings"
2011-09-29T11:13:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,set the environment variables to the correct langauge
2011-09-29T11:14:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"but again - they are just warnings, there is no error there"
2011-09-29T11:14:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,how do I know what the correct language is?
2011-09-29T11:15:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"it's your machine, you know what languages you set it to"
2011-09-29T11:15:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,it's a VPS
2011-09-29T11:15:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,so ?
2011-09-29T11:16:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,I didn't set the OS up
2011-09-29T11:16:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"it's your OS though, so you know how it's setup"
2011-09-29T11:18:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,so that local is not installed on your machine
2011-09-29T11:21:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"I have just checked, it it installed"
2011-09-29T11:21:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,not according to your system

2011-09-29T11:23:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,that doesn't mean the actual file is there as the error says
2011-09-29T11:24:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,what do I do to get it there?
2011-11-01T12:40:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,define stop and start
2011-11-01T12:41:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,I click the Enable Networking icon twice
2011-11-01T12:41:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,is this wired or wireless
2011-11-01T12:41:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,wired

2011-11-01T12:45:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,that sounds normal.
2011-11-01T12:45:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"have a look in the syslog, when you put the network card in do you see the device come up, eg: link detected eth0 connected at 100mbs etc"

2011-11-18T16:23:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,I want to re-export LANG from tr_TR.UTF-8 to en_US.UTF-8
2011-11-18T16:23:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,that would be in your .bashrc
2011-11-18T16:23:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,what about system-wide?
2011-11-18T16:24:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,/etc/bash.bashrc?

2011-11-18T16:24:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,I'm trying to remember what the debian version of /etc/sysconfig/lang is

2011-12-19T12:14:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,why do you need it ?
2011-12-19T12:14:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,to be on the latest stable?
2011-12-19T12:14:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,why ?
2011-12-19T12:15:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,is there a problem with it?
2011-12-19T12:15:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"no, but is there a problem with what ubuntu ships/supports/manages ?"
2011-12-19T12:16:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,no
2011-12-19T12:16:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"ok, so why update and break that"
2011-12-19T12:16:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,what is in the version you want to use that is not in the version ships with apache
2011-12-19T12:17:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"no idea really, just the tendency to be on the latest"
2011-12-19T12:17:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,that is a very very bad tendency
2011-12-19T12:17:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,I would try to break that habbit if I where you
2011-12-19T12:18:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"generally, or only for ubuntu?"
2011-12-19T12:18:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,generally

2012-03-16T18:48:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,then you have your answer

2012-06-18T17:30:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,I appreciate that may sound lazy
2012-06-18T17:30:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,could you at least take a look at my alsa-info.sh output?
2012-06-18T17:31:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"if you want, sure"
2012-06-18T17:32:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,that suggests the sound card is an intel
2012-06-18T17:32:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,lspci says sis
2012-06-18T17:32:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"yes, I see that too"
2012-06-18T17:32:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"it looks like it's loading the intel modules,"
2012-06-18T17:33:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"yes, I see that, I wonder if you are having the issues because it's loading the intel modules, rather than the SIS"
2012-06-18T17:34:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"hmm, no issues on output tho"
2012-06-18T17:34:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,where to check that?
2012-06-18T17:34:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"very interesting, that maybe something that's worth exploring,"
2012-06-18T17:34:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,see if the intel modules have any limitations against the sis card
2012-06-18T17:35:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"from experience the SIS chips just cause problems, that doesn't mean yours wont' work, but I've never had an easy time setting one up"
2012-06-18T17:38:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,blacklist snd_intel8x0m <--- this maybe?
2012-06-18T17:39:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"try it, not sure that will get you far, but worth a try"

2012-06-20T00:23:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,you cannot upgrade from the desktop CD
2012-06-20T00:24:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,you can only upgrade from the alternative CD
2012-06-20T00:24:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"and you do not boot from it, as then you would be running from the CD (read only) not your system"

2012-09-18T12:12:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,can you help me fix this problem?
2012-09-18T12:12:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"not really, it's flash"
2012-09-18T12:12:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,I don't know why you uninstalled on package if it worked
2012-09-18T12:12:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,that crached on me as well
2012-09-18T12:13:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,ok.....I'm starting to see a picture that that tsite may not be compatible
2012-09-18T12:13:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,it's fb
2012-09-18T12:13:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,I'm not using any flash on facebook
2012-09-18T12:14:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"when I try to open a video on facebook, I get that 'Shockwave Flash crashed'"

2012-09-18T12:15:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,care to let me know why?
2012-09-18T12:16:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"yeah, flash is a waste of time for me on linux, it's closed and too much effort to try to work problems thorugh"
2012-11-01T13:10:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,sounds like you did more than install the xen kernel
2012-11-01T13:23:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"sorry it was libc.so.6. I did a apt-file search libc.so.6 and found out that it's provided by libc6, and dpkg-query -l libc6 says ii"
2012-11-01T13:23:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"yes, that's glibc"
2012-11-01T13:26:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"so, what to do?"
2012-11-01T13:26:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,your system is broken you are missing core libc libraries
2012-11-01T13:26:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,you need to work out what you've done to remove it
2012-11-01T13:30:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,I suspect you have made a mistake somewhere or not seen somethin on screen
2012-11-01T13:33:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,are you using 32bit ?
2012-11-01T13:33:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"ok, so you are probably missing a symlink to /lib"
2012-11-01T13:34:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,from where?
2012-11-01T13:34:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,think about it
2012-11-01T13:34:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,what you've got and what I'v ejust said
2012-11-10T15:52:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,what unity scripts ?
2012-11-10T15:53:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,what ?
2012-11-10T15:54:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"when we write a script, we can copy it to a directory and it becomes available in file context menu"
2012-11-10T15:54:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,who is 'we' ?
2012-11-10T15:58:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"no idea, I'd have to look it up"
2012-11-10T16:01:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,would ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts work with unity?
2012-11-10T16:01:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"doubtful, but I dont know"
2012-11-30T19:35:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,isn't that the package ?
2008-06-16T15:26:00.000Z,Kartagis,,when I check dmesg
2008-06-16T15:28:00.000Z,Kartagis,,can i get help please?
2008-06-16T15:28:00.000Z,Kartagis,,"I got the error Error inserting wlan_scan_sta (/lib/modules/2.6.24-18-generic/net/wlan_scan_sta.ko): Unknown symbol in module, or unknown parameter (see dmesg) when I did a modprobe wlan_scan_sta"
2008-06-16T15:28:00.000Z,Kartagis,,as described on http://www.ubuntugeek.com/atheros-5007eg-with-madwifi-on-i386-platform.html. any ideas why?
2008-06-16T15:29:00.000Z,Kartagis,,"when I check dmesg, I get http://paste.ubuntu.com/20563/"
2008-06-16T15:29:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"that module either requires a depenant module, or is not compatbile with that kernel"
2008-06-16T15:29:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,where did you get that module
2008-06-16T15:30:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,http://snapshots.madwifi.org/special/madwifi-ng-r2756+ar5007.tar.gz
2008-06-16T15:30:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,looks like that module won't run against your current version
2008-06-16T15:31:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,do a modinfo against it see if it needs a dependant module ?
2008-06-16T15:33:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,http://paste.ubuntu.com/20587/
2008-06-16T15:43:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,can you help me with that?
2008-06-17T17:52:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,got the video codec installed ?
2008-06-17T17:52:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"not sure, how to check?"
2008-06-17T18:04:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,how can I check if I have the codecs? totem plays fine
2008-06-17T18:04:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"then you should have the codecs, is mplayer linked against it"
2008-06-17T18:04:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,how do I check that?
2008-06-17T18:06:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"oh, the other file played well"
2008-08-23T16:07:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,look in the syslog
2008-08-23T16:09:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,/var/log/messages doesn't have an answer
2008-08-23T16:10:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,what does it say about it when it starts up
2008-08-23T16:10:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,rndc: connect failed: 127.0.0.1#953: connection refused
2008-08-23T16:10:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,that can't be everything
2008-08-23T16:11:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,you should see a 'starting bind' message
2008-08-23T16:12:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,/etc/init.d/bind9 start
2008-08-23T16:12:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,look in the syslog
2008-08-23T16:12:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,you should have more info
2008-08-23T16:13:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,or consider passing -d9 as a startup option to gain a LOT of debugging info
2008-08-23T16:18:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,I don't get any messages
2008-08-23T16:18:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,start bind with -d9 options
2008-08-23T16:18:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,is named now running ?
2008-08-23T16:19:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,Kartagis -d 9
2008-08-23T16:20:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"as did I, I just looked at the man page"
2008-08-23T16:20:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,nothing
2008-08-23T16:20:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,how did you install bind
2008-08-23T16:20:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,apt-get install bind9
2008-08-23T16:22:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,/var/log/syslog
2008-08-23T16:23:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,I think this is it. Aug 23 14:20:18 tolga-desktop kernel: [16038.430263] audit(1219490418.061:26): type=1503 operation='inode_create' requested_mask='w::' denied_mask='w::' name='/etc/init.d/named.run' pid=11880 profile='/usr/sbin/named' namespace='default'
2008-08-23T16:24:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,should be more than that
2008-08-23T16:24:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"nope, that's it"
2008-08-23T16:25:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,grep through that syslog for named
2008-08-23T16:25:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,also how did you install bind
2008-08-23T16:25:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"oh, I found things"
2008-08-23T16:25:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,apt-get install bind9
2008-08-23T16:26:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"ok, so thats a good start"
2008-08-23T16:31:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,I found the problem. i just have to fiddle a bit with the .conf
2008-08-23T16:31:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,good
2008-08-23T16:32:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,thanks for pointing me out to syslog. I though it would be messages
2008-08-26T00:54:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,what's the issue
2008-08-26T00:54:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,my hosted domains won't resolve
2008-08-26T00:55:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"ok - so tell me more about the issue, show me your bind config, show me your zone file, show me your resolv.conf, explain what happens when you try to resolve"
2008-08-26T00:55:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,use the pastebin
2008-08-26T00:55:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,and therefore I can't receive any emails
2008-08-26T01:00:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"when I try to resolve, I get connection timed out; no servers could be reached. my files are at http://pastebin.com/f7bca3ce3"
2008-08-26T01:00:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"ok - so the first issue is the dns servers,"
2008-08-26T01:00:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,exactly
2008-08-26T01:01:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"it appears to not be able to contact a dns server, that either means your dns server isn't running - or it is pointing at a non-existant one"
2008-08-26T01:04:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"it should listen to port 953 too, no?"
2008-08-26T01:04:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,key is 53 tcp and udp
2008-08-26T01:05:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,53 tcp/udp is 'bind'
2008-08-26T01:07:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,it stopped by itself. now it doesn't resolve. can you help me? are you looking at my files?
2008-08-26T01:07:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"your files look fine, you may want to consider not using views until you get this working"
2008-08-26T01:08:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,it was working yesterday
2008-08-26T01:09:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"it resolve to my external IP if i keep resolv.conf at 192.168.1.1, and if I change it to 1.2 it doesn't resolve at all"
2008-08-26T01:09:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,if nothing has changed on the server then the only thing that could have changed is a.) the server that is the root server for the domain b.) a firewall
2008-08-26T01:10:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,is listening on .2 ?
2008-08-26T01:10:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,what is the difference between .1 and .2
2008-08-26T01:10:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,is this on a DSL line ?
2008-08-26T01:11:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,yes
2008-08-26T01:11:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,you know that's a really bad idea
2008-08-26T01:11:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,why?
2008-08-26T01:12:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,1.) each domain should have 2 dns servers 2.) the dns servers should be on seperate address ranges and machines 3.) the dns servers should not be on async lines 4.) a lot of ISPS will block network services 5.) home networking is not designed to deal with that
2008-08-26T01:13:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,it used to work well with my previous distribution
2008-08-26T01:13:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,that doesn't change anything I've just said
2008-08-26T01:29:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,how do I stop NetworkManager from modifying my /etc/resolv.conf everytimt I reboot?
2008-08-27T13:08:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,make sure X11 forwarding is enabled on both sides
2008-08-27T13:09:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,both sides? in config you mean?
2008-08-27T13:10:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,yes
2008-09-22T18:09:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,8.05
2008-09-22T18:09:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,what version of ubuntu are you running ?
2008-09-22T18:10:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,what happens if you install mysql-server-5.0
2008-09-22T18:10:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,it says 'already the latest version'. let me re-install
2008-09-22T18:11:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,then you already have mysql-server installed
2008-09-23T17:48:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,it does it automaticlly
2008-09-23T17:49:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,it didn't for sun-java6-jre
2008-09-23T17:49:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,what does it say
2008-09-23T17:51:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,http://paste.ubuntu.com/49668/
2008-09-23T17:52:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,is this on a 64bit machien
2008-09-23T17:52:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"bo, 32"
2008-09-23T17:53:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,first thing to do is run sudo apt-get -f install
2008-09-23T17:53:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,that is the problem 'ia32-sun-java6-bin (= 6-06-0ubuntu1) but it is not installable' the question is why
2008-09-23T17:53:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,i just did that
2008-09-23T17:54:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,is ia32-sun-java6-bin available on 6.06 ? trying installing ia32-sun-java6-bin manually
2008-09-23T17:57:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,apt-get -f install did it all
2008-10-08T18:31:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,autoheader is not installed on your system
2008-10-08T18:32:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis, command not found
2008-10-11T19:36:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,what was on the disk you replaced
2008-10-11T19:36:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,the hard disk didn't contain an OS
2008-10-11T19:36:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,what did it contain
2008-10-11T19:36:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,just my ftp partition
2008-10-11T19:37:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,what mount point
2008-10-11T19:37:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,/home/ftp
2008-10-11T19:38:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"ok, thats good then, so what you need to do is re-install grub to look at the correct partition, as it currently standands it's looking in the wrong place for menu.lst - possibly because your device.map is now wrong that you've removed that disk"
2008-10-11T19:39:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,boot up with the ubuntu livecd and then chroot?
2008-10-11T19:39:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,you don't need to chroot
2008-10-11T19:39:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"boot up from the ubuntu livecd and just re-apply grub, using the grub shell"
2008-10-11T19:40:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,i don't know how to use the grub shell
2008-10-11T19:40:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,it's explained in the !grub factoid you sent yourself
2008-10-11T19:44:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,thanks. i'm trying now
2008-10-11T19:48:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"i typed find /boot/grub/stage1 as the howto instructed, and i got 'Error 15: File not found'. what to do now?"
2008-10-11T19:52:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"i typed find /boot/grub/stage1 as the howto instructed, and i got 'Error 15: File not found'. what to do now?"
2008-10-11T21:10:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,is the router connected to the internet (look at the web status page)
2008-10-11T21:05:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,how are you connecting to the internet
2008-10-11T21:05:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,modem/router
2008-10-11T21:05:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,which one
2008-10-11T21:06:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,usrobotics 9105
2008-10-11T21:06:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,is that a modem or a router
2008-10-11T21:06:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,I assume a modem
2008-10-11T21:06:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,both
2008-10-11T21:06:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,no - it's either a modem or a router
2008-10-11T21:08:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"i get to internet through that and it had a built in firewall which lets me open up ports and route, so it's a modem/router"
2008-10-11T21:08:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,a firewall doesn't make it a router
2008-10-11T21:08:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"does the device authenticate to the internet, or does your desktop authenticate to the internet"
2008-10-11T21:08:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,the device
2008-10-11T21:08:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"ok - so it's a router, not a modem"
2008-10-11T21:09:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"how do you connect to it, ethernet"
2008-10-11T21:09:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"so, how can you help me?"
2008-10-11T21:09:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,respond to my questions
2008-10-11T21:09:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,okay it's a router then
2008-10-11T21:09:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"how do you connect to it, ethernet"
2008-10-11T21:10:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"yes, ethernet"
2008-10-11T21:12:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,i can't make a connection
2008-10-11T21:13:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,then it's a problem with the router - not ubuntu
2008-10-11T21:13:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,this happened after i reinstalled ubuntu
2008-10-11T21:13:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,on the router status page - is it connected to the internet yes/no
2008-10-11T21:14:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,i can't get to the status page
2008-10-11T21:14:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,so your ubuntu machine is not on the network then
2008-10-11T21:14:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,if you do 'ifconfig eth0' does eth0 have an ipaddress assigned
2008-10-11T21:14:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,no
2008-10-11T21:14:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,ok - so thats the problem
2008-10-11T21:14:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,I assume your router is the dhcp server ?
2008-10-11T21:15:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"when i type ifconfig eth0 up, it says ERROR while getting interface flags: No such device"
2008-10-11T21:15:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,I didn't say to do that
2008-10-11T21:16:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,I asked if your router was your dhcp server
2008-10-11T21:16:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"yes, it's dhcp server"
2008-10-11T21:16:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,ok - so if you do 'ifconfig eth0' do you get a response other than 'no such interface'
2008-10-11T21:16:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,nope
2008-10-11T21:16:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,so if you do ifconfig eth0 you get 'no such device'
2008-10-11T21:17:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"when i type ifconfig eth0 up, it says ERROR while getting interface flags: No such device. when I type ifconfig eth0, it says error fetching interface information: Device not found"
2008-10-11T21:18:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,right - so if you do an 'ifconfig -a' what do you see ?
2008-10-11T21:18:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,only lo
2008-10-11T21:18:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"ok - so thats the problem, your network card is not loaded, so ubuntu can't see anything on it"
2008-10-11T21:19:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,what type of card is it
2008-10-11T21:19:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,lspci somehow doesn't show it
2008-10-11T21:20:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,then looks like you may have a hardware error
2008-10-11T21:23:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,did you get the last message about your hardware maybe having a problem
2008-10-11T21:29:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,but this happened after a re-install. and the mouse isn't working either
2008-10-11T21:29:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,it looks like a hardware issue
2008-10-11T21:29:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,maybe the reboot shorted something
2008-10-11T21:29:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,if lspci cant see it
2008-10-11T21:33:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,what about the mouse not working?
2008-10-11T21:33:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"as I said, maybe something is lose, or the motherboard got shorted on a reboot"
2008-10-11T21:33:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"I can understand things not working, but not being listed as hardware means the motherboard can't 'see' it"
2008-10-11T21:52:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,where did you ask for this ?
2008-10-11T21:52:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,at the very start
2008-10-11T21:52:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,start of what ?
2008-10-11T21:52:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,installation
2008-10-11T21:52:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"oh, don't know why then"
2008-10-13T16:14:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,installed other langue packs ?
2008-10-13T16:14:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"no, i thought that was done automatically since it was done so on my laptop"
2008-10-13T16:15:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,don't think so
2008-10-13T16:33:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,I don't believe so
2008-10-13T16:33:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"but I could be wrong on that, I never use that method"
2008-11-03T17:42:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,what do you mean ?
2008-11-03T17:43:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,the certificate needed to connect to our wpa2 connection
2008-11-03T17:43:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,how is the certificate offered ?
2008-11-03T17:43:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,i think in .cer format?
2008-11-03T17:44:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,errrr are you sure thats fore your wireless connection
2008-11-03T17:44:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,let me see
2009-01-07T18:31:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,it will remove anything from the ldap-server meta package
2009-01-07T18:32:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,thanks
2009-01-15T17:04:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"any text editor, or scream maybe"
2009-01-16T14:36:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,when you launch it - it will segfault
2009-01-16T14:36:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,report the output to the developers
2009-03-20T12:49:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,no there is not
2009-04-29T13:14:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"let me ask something. when i boot off livecd, everything will be working right? usb specifically"
2009-04-29T13:15:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"should be unless you need propritary modules, or specific configs"
2009-04-29T13:15:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,i need to recover stuff from a windows laptop
2009-04-29T13:16:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,ok ?
2009-07-06T17:02:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,that is unsupported
2009-07-06T17:02:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,yes
2010-02-03T15:11:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,if you want
2010-02-03T15:12:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,is there an alternative?
2010-04-27T13:38:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,how can I upgrade my libc6 to 16? my version is 15
2010-04-27T13:38:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,why do you want to
2010-04-27T13:38:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,changing libc versions is highly dangerous
2010-04-27T13:39:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,I have a problem with nslookup. netadmin said this could be solved with upgrading libc6
2010-04-27T13:40:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"1.) nslookup is depreciated 2.) changing libc should not be done at all,"
2010-04-27T13:40:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,even dig cannot resolve it
2010-04-27T13:40:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,then it won't be a libc issue
2010-04-27T13:42:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"I take full responsibility, I've to try it"
2010-04-27T13:43:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,what are you trying to resolve ?
2010-04-27T13:43:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,if dig can't resolve it it won't be a libc issue
2010-04-27T13:43:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,what version of ubuntu is this on
2010-04-27T13:43:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,rapidshare and 9.10
2010-04-27T13:44:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,what command are you using that's failing
2010-04-27T13:45:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"when I say what command, exactly what host are you tyring to look up"
2010-04-27T13:45:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=161181 here is the problem
2010-04-27T13:45:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,that's a redhat bug
2010-04-27T13:45:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,don't use that as a reference
2010-04-27T13:46:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,my web browser can't resolve it
2010-04-27T13:46:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"can't resolve what exactly, what host are you trying to resolve exactly"
2010-04-27T13:46:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,rapidshare.com
2010-04-27T13:47:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,ok - I can say for a FACT that is not a libc issue
2010-04-27T13:47:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"I'm using 9.10 and can resolve that fine, and nslookup and dig are not relevant to your web browser"
2010-04-27T13:48:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,netadmin said ubuntu with windows in virtualbox has that issue and it can be resolved by upgrading libc6
2010-04-27T13:49:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,do not do it
2010-04-27T13:49:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,can you resolve any hosts with your webbrowser ?
2010-04-27T13:50:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"other than rapidshare, yes. and my vm can resolve it too"
2010-04-27T13:50:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,ok so the resolver is fine
2010-04-27T13:53:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,I get this nslookup rapidshare.com
2010-04-27T13:53:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,not good
2010-04-27T13:56:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,http://suigeneris.pastebin.com/EEtX6bUg
2010-04-27T13:57:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"yes, a coredump does not look good at all,"
2010-04-27T13:57:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,interesting why it's just that one host
2010-04-27T13:58:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,and the netadmin said this could be solved with upgrading libc
2010-04-27T13:58:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,who is 'the netadmin' ?
2010-04-27T13:58:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,netadmin of our firm
2010-04-27T13:58:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,then ask him to support that
2010-04-27T13:59:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"I take full responsibility, please tell me how to do it"
2010-04-27T13:59:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,speak to your netadmin
2010-04-27T13:59:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"if he thinks that will fix it, he will kow how to do it"
2010-06-22T15:24:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,because you don't mount network devices as vfat
2010-06-22T15:25:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,whether it's linux or windows?
2010-06-22T15:25:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"either way, you don't mount network file systems as vfat, it has to be a network file system such as nfs/samba/cifs"
2010-06-23T16:13:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,there are id3 taggers in the repo
2010-06-23T16:13:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,all will allow you to grab the tag
2010-06-23T16:14:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,I installed mp3info but that works with ID3 1.x ?
2010-06-23T16:14:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,should do
2010-06-23T16:15:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,do you know of one that works with ID3 2.x ?
2010-06-23T16:15:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"most do, check out the descriptions when you search"
2010-07-27T12:28:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"that reminds me, what player would we need?"
2010-07-27T12:29:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,any will work as long as the codecs are supported
2010-07-27T12:32:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,what are the codecs that will support hd movies? or will totem retrieve the codecs automatically?
2010-07-27T12:32:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,they are listed in the DVD section of https://help.ubuntu.com
2010-10-22T22:08:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,pleasea pastebin your sources.list

2010-10-22T22:12:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,why do you have kamric and maverick repos enabled at the same time
2010-10-22T22:13:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,a few days ago I downgraded php
2010-10-22T22:13:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,that is totally unsupported mixing repos your system will now be unstable
2010-10-22T22:14:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,I won't help any futher
2010-10-22T22:14:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,should I delete them?
2010-10-22T22:14:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"too late in my view, damage done"
2010-10-22T22:14:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"but yes, certainly delete them"
2010-11-19T15:21:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,what are you trying to build
2010-11-19T15:21:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,vmware-server
2010-11-19T15:21:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,you need the kernel source package
2010-11-19T15:22:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,what  package exactly?
2010-11-19T15:22:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,the kernel source package for the kernel y ou are running
2010-11-19T15:31:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,I've installed linux-source-2.6.35 but I still get that message
2010-11-19T15:31:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,what message ?
2010-11-19T15:32:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,look in /usr/src - what's there
2010-11-19T15:33:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,http://pastebin.com/ccQBXjPt
2010-11-19T15:33:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,you need a symlink to linux-source-2.6.35 from linux
2011-04-05T13:56:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,domains to what application
2011-04-05T13:57:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,postfix and dovecot
2011-04-05T13:57:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"ok, then it depends how they are setup"
2011-04-06T11:59:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,#postfix
2011-04-06T11:59:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,the main issue appears to be permissions on the file system though
2011-04-06T12:04:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,I suggest you work with one person as the guys in #postfix are also guiding you down a seperate path than noisewaterphd
2011-04-06T12:07:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,you've said that
2011-04-06T12:07:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"now tighten it up - you're going to end up in a mess as you are doing two different things, one from noisewaterphd in here and one from random_guy in #postfix that are differnt"
2011-04-08T15:12:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,are you using virtual users or real system users in
2011-04-08T15:12:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,real
2011-04-08T15:13:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,then you need to change the users home directory in real life
2011-04-08T15:17:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,thanks.
2011-04-08T15:40:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,try logging in as the user outside ftp
2011-04-08T15:42:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,excuse me? what do you mean?
2011-04-08T15:42:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,I mean login to the users account using ssh rather than ftp
2011-04-08T15:45:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"I was able to ssh in, but then that means useradd -p userpass user failed, because I had to do passwd user again"
2011-04-08T15:53:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"I was able to ssh in, but then that means useradd -p userpass user failed, because I had to do passwd user again. could that be possible?"
2011-04-08T16:23:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,do you know what encryption user passwords use?
2011-04-08T16:23:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,sha I think
2011-04-08T16:24:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,just told you the problem
2011-04-08T16:25:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"sorry, not you"
2011-04-08T17:51:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,is the file there

2011-04-08T17:55:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,see which one is failing
2011-04-08T17:59:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,there's only one command
2011-04-08T17:59:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,so run the show me the command

2011-06-14T17:03:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,should I get ntpdate?
2011-06-14T17:03:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"that is a one off setting, use ntpd"
2011-06-14T17:04:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,Unable to locate package ntpd
2011-06-14T17:04:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,the package is ntp

2011-06-17T13:29:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,is that anything to do with ubuntu
2011-06-17T13:29:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"ok, so please keep the non-ubuntu stuff out please."
2011-06-23T15:11:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,why would you want to do that ?
2011-06-23T15:12:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,netadmin says 5.8p1 is blocked by IDS
2011-06-23T15:13:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,then you should talk to your netadmin guys as downgrading ssh to a less secure/bug version is backwards instead of updating the netadmin rules
2011-06-23T15:14:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"I don't quite understand. I think if I downgrade to a previous version, the chances of IDS blocking me is slim. why should I talk to netadmin?"
2011-06-23T15:15:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,to get the IDS to not block the better version of SSH
2011-06-23T15:15:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"that's about me I think, not netadmin or IDS"
2011-06-23T15:16:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,what ?
2011-06-23T15:16:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"if your IDS is blocking the new SSH version, update your IDS to not block the newer ssh version, don't downgrade ssh"
2011-06-23T15:17:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,I don't think I can get the netadmin to upgrade IDS
2011-06-23T15:17:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,the chances are next to none
2011-06-23T15:17:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,why ?
2011-06-23T15:17:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,thickheads
2011-06-23T15:17:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,why would someone block the more secure version of SSH - but leave it open for the less secure version
2011-06-23T15:17:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,then you'll need to research package pinning and re-install openssh once the package is pinned
2011-06-23T15:19:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,thanks
2011-06-23T15:57:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"I'm trying package pinning, I've typed sudo apt-get install openssh-server=5.3p1-3ubuntu6 but it says it doesn't have this version. any ideas?"
2011-06-23T15:58:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,does it have that version in the ubuntu version you are using ?

2011-06-23T16:03:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,I am using natty. I thought package pinning was done if you want to install an earlier version
2011-06-23T16:03:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"you don't use packages from earlier versions, just an earlier package version within your current distro"
2011-06-23T16:04:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,eg: and earlier natty package for you
2011-06-23T16:04:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,I think natty has only 5.8p1
2011-06-23T16:04:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,can't do it then
2011-06-23T16:07:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,in what section can I see openssh version on http://packages.ubuntu.com
2011-06-23T16:07:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,what ?
2011-06-23T16:11:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,what do you want to know ?
2011-06-23T16:11:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,you can't use lucid packages with natty
2011-06-23T16:12:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,so I have to luck but persuade netadmin to upgrade IDS?
2011-06-23T16:12:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,or not use natty
2011-08-14T15:55:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"lucid is an LTS release, natty isn't thats why you've not been notified"
2011-08-14T15:56:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"can you help me with my problem? ubuntu dims the display everytime I start a GUI program with dare background, like terminal"
2011-09-24T13:27:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,are the video cards different
2011-09-24T13:28:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"could be, I'm not sure. can't check now because the one at work is off"
2011-09-24T13:28:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"worth checking,"
2011-09-24T13:29:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,and if they are?
2011-09-24T13:29:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"well, that's where I'd start investigating"
2011-09-24T13:29:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,what codecs can I install here?
2011-09-24T13:30:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,is that the one thats working (I bet not)
2011-09-24T13:31:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,that's the one failing
2011-09-24T13:31:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"SIS video card, terrible, lots of problems. Not surprised it's failing"
2011-09-28T23:51:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,grep $username /etc/passwd and lets see the restuls (it contains no password inforamtion)

2011-09-28T23:53:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,is the user the owner ?
2011-09-28T23:53:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,(and look at the permissions on /srv and /srv/www as the user needs to be able to get into them to see his home dir
2011-09-28T23:53:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,yes
2011-09-28T23:54:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,if you su - $user

2011-09-29T00:09:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,I don't want to get them
2011-09-29T00:09:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,why ? are they causing you problems ?
2011-09-29T00:09:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,they are just warnings

2011-09-29T00:10:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"they shouldn't do, hence them being warnings"
2011-09-29T11:15:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"or you could just ignore them, they are just warnings"
2011-09-29T11:13:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,set the environment variables to the correct langauge

2011-09-29T11:16:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,I didn't set the OS up
2011-09-29T11:16:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"it's your OS though, so you know how it's setup"
2011-09-29T11:18:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,so that local is not installed on your machine

2011-09-29T11:24:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,what do I do to get it there?

2011-12-19T12:15:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,is there a problem with it?
2011-12-19T12:15:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"no, but is there a problem with what ubuntu ships/supports/manages ?"

2011-12-19T12:16:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,what is in the version you want to use that is not in the version ships with apache
2011-12-19T12:17:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,"no idea really, just the tendency to be on the latest"
2011-12-19T12:17:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,that is a very very bad tendency
2011-12-19T12:17:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,I would try to break that habbit if I where you

2012-06-18T17:32:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,that suggests the sound card is an intel

2012-06-18T17:34:00.000Z,Kartagis,ikonia,where to check that?
2012-06-18T17:34:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"very interesting, that maybe something that's worth exploring,"
2012-06-18T17:34:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,see if the intel modules have any limitations against the sis card
2012-06-18T17:35:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"from experience the SIS chips just cause problems, that doesn't mean yours wont' work, but I've never had an easy time setting one up"

2012-11-01T13:30:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,I suspect you have made a mistake somewhere or not seen somethin on screen
2012-11-01T13:33:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,are you using 32bit ?
2012-11-01T13:33:00.000Z,ikonia,Kartagis,"ok, so you are probably missing a symlink to /lib"
