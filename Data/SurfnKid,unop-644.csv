2007-02-10T06:05:00.000Z,SurfnKid,,a remote linux box
2007-02-10T06:07:00.000Z,SurfnKid,,this is weird it doesnt let me go thru root
2007-02-10T06:08:00.000Z,SurfnKid,,"well I did a connect to.. selected SSH and put the ip of the box, then below i put username, and i put root"
2007-02-10T06:08:00.000Z,SurfnKid,,i put the password
2007-02-10T06:08:00.000Z,SurfnKid,,but didnt accept it
2007-02-10T06:08:00.000Z,SurfnKid,,ah
2007-02-10T06:09:00.000Z,SurfnKid,,"yeah, here's the reason why"
2007-02-10T06:09:00.000Z,SurfnKid,,i hate to move files to /tmp then i have to log into the remote box and move them to /var/www
2007-02-10T06:09:00.000Z,SurfnKid,,ok
2007-02-10T06:10:00.000Z,SurfnKid,,but im using nautilus to view the files
2007-02-10T06:10:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," yea, if you make your user a member of www-data (i think thats the group name) .. your user should have the right access to /var/www"
2007-02-10T06:11:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"so do i create the username im currently on, on the remote p?"
2007-02-10T06:11:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," no, just add your current username (e.g. surfnkid) to the www-data group"
2007-02-10T06:12:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,but its a remote box does tha tmatter?
2007-02-10T06:12:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,the remote box doesnt have my username
2007-02-10T06:12:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," ok, in that case -- add the user name you log into ssh with on the remote box to the www-data group (on the remote box) :)"
2007-02-10T06:12:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,ah ok that makes more sense
2007-02-10T06:13:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,i would love complete access to that remotely
2007-02-10T06:14:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," the www-data group has read/write access in that folder - if your user is a member of that group, you get those priveleges too"
2007-02-10T06:15:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, this is pretty much like windows user administration (infact micrsoft copied and enhanced the unix permissions model)
2007-02-10T06:15:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"done, added, now to try... :)"
2007-02-10T06:15:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,hah i didnt know that
2007-02-10T06:17:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"ok nothing, but here's what i did"
2007-02-10T06:18:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,added the user on the remote box to the www-blah group
2007-02-10T06:18:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, sorry for being pedantic -- but its www-data not www-blah :)
2007-02-10T06:18:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"came back to my laptop and selected  Connect to Server...  SSH, set the IP, and then the username"
2007-02-10T06:18:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,lol i mean that yeah
2007-02-10T06:19:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," errm, did you check that your user is indeed in that group now?  use  id or groups to verify"
2007-02-10T06:20:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,i went to user/groups in the menu
2007-02-10T06:21:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," yep, the www-data group only has rx permissions .. as you can see there"
2007-02-10T06:21:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,maybe i have to set the rw permissions on-that-folder
2007-02-10T06:22:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," no, its likely that those are the default permissions"
2007-02-10T06:23:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"if i change the folder permission to full access, will that enable it?"
2007-02-10T06:24:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," errm, all i think you need to do is change the ownership of the folder -- sudo sh -c 'chown www-data.www-data /var/www; chmod 774 /var/www/'"
2007-02-10T06:24:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"wow, you know this stuff well.. ok let me check something brb"
2007-02-10T06:27:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, you should know that the other directories and files within /var/www/* will still retain the old permissions -- jsut to make you aware
2007-02-10T06:28:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"oh right, kind of like parent/child perm"
2007-02-10T06:28:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, exactly :)
2007-02-10T06:29:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, it shoudlnt cause any problems for the time being -- but just be aware incase you do have problems
2007-02-10T06:30:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,well yeah i do need child access i have 2 folders which are specifically the ones i need access to
2007-02-10T06:31:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, sudo sh -c 'chown -R www-data.www-data /var/www; chmod -R 774 /var/www/'
2007-02-10T06:31:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,ok let me try that
2007-02-10T06:33:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,hmm now my permissions are denied
2007-02-10T06:34:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,after running sudo sh -c 'chown -R www-data.www-data /var/www;  chmod -R 774 /var/www/'
2007-02-10T06:35:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, permissions denied on what?
2007-02-10T06:35:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,to enter/view the folder
2007-02-10T06:36:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," ok, can you pastebin this -- sudo ls -ld /var/www"
2007-02-10T06:37:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,drwxrwxr-- 5 www-data www-data 4096 2007-01-31 04:48 /var/www
2007-02-10T06:38:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," ok, this too --  whoami; id;"
2007-02-10T06:39:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,http://www.pastebin.ca/348225
2007-02-10T06:41:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, if you look at the output of id -- www-data is not among them .. which explains why you cant list that directory
2007-02-10T06:42:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,:/ so then do i add www-data to another group?
2007-02-10T06:45:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, run this command on the remote machine - sudo usermod -G www-data $USER
2007-02-10T06:47:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"i did, returned nothing"
2007-02-10T06:47:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"tried to view the /var/www folder, nothing"
2007-02-10T06:47:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, that indicates successs -- verify group membership with id
2007-02-10T06:47:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,gotcha
2007-02-10T06:49:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"um i cant do anything, I cant get into user/groups how do i get back the access?"
2007-02-10T06:50:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid,what does the id command return?
2007-02-10T06:51:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,just --- id ?
2007-02-10T06:51:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, yep
2007-02-10T06:52:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,http://www.pastebin.ca/348235
2007-02-10T06:53:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," errm, still no change -- have you tried logging off and logging back in?"
2007-02-10T06:53:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,that could help right :)
2007-02-10T06:53:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, indeed
2007-02-10T06:56:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,now i should run id ?
2007-02-10T06:56:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,let me see
2007-02-10T06:56:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"uid=1000(sx270) gid=1000(sx270) grupos=33(www-data),1000(sx270)"
2007-02-10T06:57:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," ok, hold tight -- i'm coming to the rescue :)"
2007-02-10T06:57:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,ok np
2007-02-10T07:02:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," ok, first command - sudo usermod -G $USER"
2007-02-10T07:03:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, second command : for i in adm dialout cdrom floppy audio dip video plugdev lpadmin scanner admin sx270; do echo sudo usermod -g $i; done
2007-02-10T07:03:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid,correction ..  second command : for i in adm dialout cdrom floppy audio dip video plugdev lpadmin scanner admin sx270; do sudo usermod -g $i; done
2007-02-10T07:07:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, do you want the command again? let me know if you do :)
2007-02-10T07:10:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,could you pm the commands separately plz i got confused
2007-02-10T07:10:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," ok, coming up"
2007-02-10T07:11:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid,  sudo usermod -G $USER;  for i in adm dialout cdrom floppy audio dip video plugdev lpadmin scanner admin sx270; do sudo usermod -g $i; done
2007-02-10T07:11:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," oops, hold on"
2007-02-10T07:11:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid,  sudo usermod -G $USER $USER;  for i in adm dialout cdrom floppy audio dip video plugdev lpadmin scanner admin sx270; do sudo usermod -g $i; done
2007-02-10T07:15:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,should have a pm there waiting
2007-02-10T07:16:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid,i was just going to ask how it was going -- i got no PM (are you registered on these servers?)
2007-02-10T07:16:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,yeah hmmm
2007-02-10T07:17:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,argh now i am
2007-02-10T07:17:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, i just sent you two pms
2007-02-10T07:18:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,me too lol
2007-02-10T07:18:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, looks good so far -- one last command -- sudo usermod -g www-data $USER
2007-02-10T07:19:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop, ok
2007-02-10T07:19:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,i get perm. denied
2007-02-10T07:19:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"well it didnt return anything, but couldnt get into the /var/www folder"
2007-02-10T07:20:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, log off and log back on -- it should work now
2007-02-10T07:20:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,was about to do that :) brb
2007-02-10T07:24:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"ok done.. i checked to see if i could enter into the user/group settings, but its not in the menu"
2007-02-10T07:24:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,how do i get that back?
2007-02-10T07:25:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, aren't you logging in to the remote machine via SSH ?
2007-02-10T07:26:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"sure, but it is also being used"
2007-02-10T07:26:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, so you using X over ssh?
2007-02-10T07:26:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,if i understand that correctly yes
2007-02-10T07:27:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," ok, errm, what happens when you type this at the command line -- gksudo users-admin ?"
2007-02-10T07:27:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,im not too familiar with the whole X over ssh yet :P
2007-02-10T07:27:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," well, i just had to make sure that you are working on the remote machine and not on the local one :p"
2007-02-10T07:28:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"oh right, nah im on the remote one. i ran it and returned it got an error, i couldnt execute this task"
2007-02-10T07:29:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, whats the exact error?
2007-02-10T07:29:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,can you set it back to the way it was maybe my idea isnt supported since its X over ssh
2007-02-10T07:29:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"its in spanish, ill try to translate ' Cant Execute users-admin'"
2007-02-10T07:30:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"big red Prohibited sign, says' the mechanism for authorization does not allow to execute this program, Contact the System Administrator'"
2007-02-10T07:30:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, effectively all i have done is add your user to the www-data groups -- i did screw up with usermod but then i restored your group membership - i'm trying now to ascertain why you arent able to see menu items
2007-02-10T07:31:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, are you sure you are using 'gksudo' there?    gksudo users-admin ?
2007-02-10T07:31:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"can you reverse the www-data command that was put on earlier, maybe if i put it back itll all be back to normal"
2007-02-10T07:31:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,yeah gksudo
2007-02-10T07:32:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, the www-data group shouldnt have bearing on this -- can you paste the output of id again to verify that the commands i gave you did indeed run
2007-02-10T07:33:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,sure no probs hang on
2007-02-10T07:35:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,check pm
2007-02-10T07:35:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," ohh ouch, i just closed that tab .. paste again please :p"
2007-02-10T07:35:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, i had some output from you there but wasnt sure if it was from a previous paste :)
2007-02-10T07:36:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"yeah had a previous VT still logged on, was not aware of it"
2007-02-10T07:36:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,check Surfnkid   not SurfnKid_
2007-02-10T07:36:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," yea, got it -- hmm, that output's not right again -- hold on :p :)"
2007-02-10T07:38:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," sudo usermod -G adm,dialout,cdrom,floppy,audio,dip,video,plugdev,lpadmin,scanner,admin,sx270 $USER"
2007-02-10T07:39:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"done, didnt return anything  log out?"
2007-02-10T07:40:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," yea, to be safe"
2007-02-10T07:40:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,okies
2007-02-10T07:42:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"logged back in and checked the menus, they are still not all visible"
2007-02-10T07:43:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, bahh ..these kids arent helping either -- paste id again please
2007-02-10T07:44:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,sure
2007-02-10T07:45:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"uid=1000(sx270) gid=1000(sx270) grupos=33(www-data),1000(sx270)"
2007-02-10T07:48:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,doesnt look like it changed
2007-02-10T07:48:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," yea, try it again - sudo usermod -G adm,dialout,cdrom,floppy,audio,dip,video,plugdev,lpadmin,scanner,admin,sx270 $USER"
2007-02-10T07:50:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,nothing
2007-02-10T07:50:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,the menu isnt visible
2007-02-10T07:51:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, but does the command succeed?
2007-02-10T07:51:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,still cant execute
2007-02-10T07:51:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"oh wait, i need sudo dont i?"
2007-02-10T07:51:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid,it's sudo that needs to succeed
2007-02-10T07:52:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,hmmm do i run sudo gksudo users-admin though?
2007-02-10T07:52:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"oh i get what you mean, cuz im on the GUI"
2007-02-10T07:52:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, gksudo users-admin should be enough
2007-02-10T07:53:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, gksudo is the GUI equivalent to sudo
2007-02-10T07:53:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,yeah i just remembered
2007-02-10T07:53:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," ok, well, i was interested in how the sudo usermod .. command fared really?"
2007-02-10T07:54:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"hmm well it doesnt return anything once i enter the command, just returns the prompt"
2007-02-10T07:55:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, and this command is  'gksudo users-admin' ?? the one that just returns to the prompt?
2007-02-10T07:55:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"oh no i mean, the usermod admin and all that stuff with $USER at the end. that returns me to the prompt, then i enter gksudo users-admin and I get a window with the same cant execute this task error"
2007-02-10T07:56:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," hmm, thats so odd, because if the command succeeds, the group membership should have changed"
2007-02-10T07:56:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,oh wait sx270 is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.
2007-02-10T07:56:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid,youch.. :| not good
2007-02-10T07:57:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,yea i noticed well so how can it be set back? sx270 is the admin account
2007-02-10T07:58:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid,"this is not good at all, to use sudo, you need to be in the admin group .. but thats not the case now :("
2007-02-10T07:58:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,so im pretty much in an unadministratible system
2007-02-10T07:59:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," I'm so sorry if I did this (it wasnt intentional) ,, you should be able to boot into recovery mode and edit the /etc/groups file using nano -- quick things to do"
2007-02-10T08:00:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"well thats a solution, its not all lost :)"
2007-02-10T08:00:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,i thought it was all lost
2007-02-10T08:00:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," well unadministerable only from the current runlevel .. if you get to runlevel 1, it's recoverable"
2007-02-10T08:00:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,cables ok brb let me try to get into safe mode with my wifi card
2007-02-10T08:00:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,wicked brb
2007-02-10T08:00:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, i dunno how that happened -- but i must be to blame .. i'm terribly sorry
2007-02-10T08:01:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"its ok at least you know, many just run off lol"
2007-02-10T08:02:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, but you're in a fix here arent you? isnt this machine at a remote location?
2007-02-10T08:05:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, was this the driver for this machine or the remote one?
2007-02-10T08:05:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"oh no im on the remote machine, the one with the /var/www issue, its the wifi driver, it uses the wlan-ng prism driver, i thought wasnt going to load it, it did :)"
2007-02-10T08:06:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"im on recovery mode <on the box, yes the remote box>"
2007-02-10T08:07:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," i'm a little confused about your setup (but i'll not focus on it now) what matters is restoring the groups again -- so you in recovery mode, you got root access there?"
2007-02-10T08:07:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"yes, i mean im on the remote box, cuz its right across the room, since we were talking about my laptop=client  www=remote"
2007-02-10T08:08:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,im on recovery mode
2007-02-10T08:08:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,although it might be hard to copy and paste stuff
2007-02-10T08:08:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," oohh cool, i thought remote box as in halfway across a city or something like that :)"
2007-02-10T08:08:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"oh hell no, i would be having cpr by now"
2007-02-10T08:08:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," no no, all we need to do is edit the /etc/groups file"
2007-02-10T08:09:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,might want to pm that
2007-02-10T08:09:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid,ok
2007-02-10T08:10:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, you recving pms?
2007-02-10T08:10:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,hmm nope
2007-02-10T08:10:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid,ping me
2007-02-10T08:11:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,i pinged
2007-02-10T08:11:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,hmm
2007-02-10T08:11:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," no luck .. anyway, lets not waste time there - i have to go in a bit, but before that i have to see you online and happy"
2007-02-10T08:12:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid,you got root access at that terminal right? just making sure?
2007-02-10T08:12:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,yes!
2007-02-10T08:12:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid,nano /etc/groups
2007-02-10T08:12:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,yeah it says
2007-02-10T08:13:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,root@sx270
2007-02-10T08:13:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,this is gonna be hard with only one window
2007-02-10T08:13:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,but ill try
2007-02-10T08:14:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," find your usergroup in that file -- and add this to the end of the line -  sx270,adm,dialout,cdrom,floppy,audio,dip,video,plugdev,lpadmin,scanner,admin,www-data"
2007-02-10T08:14:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,could i use vim instead?
2007-02-10T08:14:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," if you are comfortable with vim sure? infact i'd use it, but not many others know how to use it"
2007-02-10T08:15:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"yeah cuz im not used to nano, ok ill get on vim"
2007-02-10T08:15:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,did you mean /etc/group
2007-02-10T08:15:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, nano really needs no getting used to  -- but vim users tend to find themselves typing ':wq' all over the place :)
2007-02-10T08:16:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,haha yeah with ! too
2007-02-10T08:16:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," ahh yea, /etc/group  -- typo"
2007-02-10T08:16:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,so find my usergroup file hang on
2007-02-10T08:17:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,ta heck is my usergroup file
2007-02-10T08:17:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,whats it named?
2007-02-10T08:17:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, sx27  i think
2007-02-10T08:18:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"oh wait sorry i see it now, its got a www-data at the end of it"
2007-02-10T08:18:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"there's 3 other users below it, but they have nothing after the :"
2007-02-10T08:19:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,do i just remove the www-data?
2007-02-10T08:19:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," ok, remove the www-data at the end of the line and add this in its place - adm,dialout,cdrom,floppy,audio,dip,video,plugdev,lpadmin,scanner,admin,www-data"
2007-02-10T08:20:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"question, how do i switch from window to window using screen?"
2007-02-10T08:21:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,how can i switch screens  when using screen
2007-02-10T08:21:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," screen, not too sure, errm, ctrl+z to background this window -- jobs -l to list jobs and fg %1 or fg %2 to bring other jobs into the foreground"
2007-02-10T08:22:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,hang on so i can get the command right
2007-02-10T08:27:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,oops sorry it rebooted
2007-02-10T08:28:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," edit /etc/group -- and add this to the end of your usergroup's line - adm,dialout,cdrom,floppy,audio,dip,video,plugdev,lpadmin,scanner,admin,www-data"
2007-02-10T08:31:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,ok up to www-data right?
2007-02-10T08:31:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,gonna add it hang on a sec
2007-02-10T08:31:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, yeop
2007-02-10T08:35:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"ok im back on normal mode, i went ahead and tried to get gksudo users-admin and it still says the same thing"
2007-02-10T08:35:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,doesnt allow me in
2007-02-10T08:35:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, what does id list?
2007-02-10T08:36:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,i was supposed to enter adm... all that next to my usergroup sx270 right?
2007-02-10T08:36:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid,it doesnt look like the edit was saved -- or it wasnt saved properly
2007-02-10T08:36:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, can you pastebin /etc/group please
2007-02-10T08:37:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,http://www.pastebin.ca/348336
2007-02-10T08:38:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"dont i have to add sx270 next to every place that says oscasr, internet ?"
2007-02-10T08:39:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, not really -- your username is sx27 right?
2007-02-10T08:40:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, this is real perplexing -- pastebin the output of this  -- whoami; id; groups;
2007-02-10T08:41:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,http://www.pastebin.ca/348341
2007-02-10T08:42:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"you had it right once, didnt you put back all the users with one of the usermod commands or something of that kind>?"
2007-02-10T08:43:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, yea it was alright -- next thing i know you have only these 2 groups -- and now i cant understand why /etc/group says one thing and id says another
2007-02-10T08:43:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, are you sure you saved the file as /etc/group ??
2007-02-10T08:44:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,ill check
2007-02-10T08:45:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"sure did, but i pressed Ctrl + D to continue booting, should i do a full reboot maybe thatll help"
2007-02-10T08:45:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,Esc  wq! saved it
2007-02-10T08:46:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,let me reboot
2007-02-10T08:46:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," yea, a reboot would definitely help :)"
2007-02-10T08:56:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,ok i did something of my own and added sx270 to the root section at the very top
2007-02-10T08:56:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,now i have users/groups on the menu
2007-02-10T08:56:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, and do you have all the default groups back in too?
2007-02-10T08:56:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, because thats what matters really
2007-02-10T08:56:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"i practically added sx270 where i thought would be needed, also in the sudo usermod"
2007-02-10T08:57:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"wow now i do user/groups from the menu and i dont even get a password, i would like to get the password verification back"
2007-02-10T08:58:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," if you just issued a command using sudo/gksudo, you will not have been prompted for a password, that is normal and expected"
2007-02-10T08:58:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, did you use a sudo command?
2007-02-10T08:58:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"actually i didnt, i chose the ubuntu menu"
2007-02-10T08:59:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, did you issue any commands at all prior to this?
2007-02-10T09:02:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,http://pastebin.ca/348357
2007-02-10T09:04:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,brb
2007-02-10T09:05:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,rebooting one more time
2007-02-10T09:10:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,is gone
2007-02-10T09:11:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, you also have your usergroup in root :o
2007-02-10T09:11:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,yeah i removed it now
2007-02-10T09:11:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, no wonder you werent prompted for a password -- because you are effectively root there
2007-02-10T09:11:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"actually it wasnt root, it was sudo"
2007-02-10T09:12:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,man i just learned stuff about admin access that is good to know!
2007-02-10T09:12:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," err ,... not from what i see here  http://pastebin.ca/348357"
2007-02-10T09:12:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"oh right, but i removed it now"
2007-02-10T09:12:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, line #1 has your usergroup in root .. dont do that
2007-02-10T09:12:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,yeah now i wont
2007-02-10T09:12:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," ok, so now whats the status of your id command? :)"
2007-02-10T09:12:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,let me check
2007-02-10T09:12:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, I hope its all good
2007-02-10T09:13:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"it is, i can now do everything as before, just needed to get the gksudo users-admin like you said back up"
2007-02-10T09:14:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, also dont forget access to /var/www :)
2007-02-10T09:14:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,lol oh yeah thats what i came in here for! http://pastebin.ca/348364
2007-02-10T09:14:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,at least i learned something new about /etc/group today
2007-02-10T09:15:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, looking good so far -- your group membership looks intact
2007-02-10T09:15:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,which one the sx270?
2007-02-10T09:15:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, you should be able to do this without a hitch now -- cd /var/www; ls -l;
2007-02-10T09:16:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,here's the /etc/group file now that i removed sudo and root http://pastebin.ca/348367
2007-02-10T09:16:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"yup, i can browse, just need to make sure I can access this box thru X over on my laptop so i can copy files directly to /var/www/*"
2007-02-10T09:16:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, whoa .. you've practically made yourself a member of every group in /etc/group -- now thats not good either
2007-02-10T09:17:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"yeah thats what i noticed to lol, help me out here, give me a list of which ones I need to be part of"
2007-02-10T09:17:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," this should be enough -- adm,dialout,cdrom,floppy,audio,dip,video,plugdev,lpadmin,scanner,admin,www-data"
2007-02-10T09:18:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"hmm interesting, im not part of some of those!"
2007-02-10T09:19:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"so remove the ones i put,replace with urs. ok hang a sec"
2007-02-10T09:19:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, these are the groups you were in before we got into this mess :)
2007-02-10T09:19:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"ah, ok thats exactly what i need back"
2007-02-10T09:20:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"ok done, gonna reboot see if it made a difference"
2007-02-10T09:21:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," hah, ok :)"
2007-02-10T09:21:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"thats the only thing that changed, nothing else"
2007-02-10T09:21:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,lets hope i can do gksudo users-admin :) brb
2007-02-10T09:26:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"looks good, i can now go into the menu select user/group asks me for password, like it should have, so i think we're good, at least I learned where the main group file is in case I ever do something I shouldnt"
2007-02-10T09:26:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," okies, looks good then -- now to your original thing -- access to /var/www"
2007-02-10T09:27:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,i guess i can do that from the /var/www folder permissions right?
2007-02-10T09:27:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,or should i use gksudo users-group
2007-02-10T09:27:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, do how you originally wanted to do it .. ssh to the remote box -- ls -l /var/www
2007-02-10T09:29:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"ok here's how i do it, from my laptop i do Connect to Server...  enter the IP, and i get access to it. Also I do use ssh at times via Terminal but i can manage copying files from there, I just really want to copy 2 3 4 or 10 files directly from my desktop to the /var/www folder thru nautilus"
2007-02-10T09:29:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,and nautilus sees the /var/www on the remote box
2007-02-10T09:30:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, well the fact you see /var/www through nautilus is promising -- i'm sure you'd be able to copy files across too
2007-02-10T09:30:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"i can see it, but cant write to it, only /tmp can be written to, do you think maybe if I set perm on the /var/www it would allow me to?"
2007-02-10T09:32:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"hmm, permissions are disabled, i cant change them, i wonder why"
2007-02-10T09:32:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," errm, you could check the permissions on it yes -- ls -ld /var/www; ls -l /var/www"
2007-02-10T09:32:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," ok, im gonna get a cuppa coffee and something to munch on -- i need a source of energy :)"
2007-02-10T09:32:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,ok sure
2007-02-10T09:33:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"at least you helped me thru, and i thank you for that, i would have to have researched how to get back, probably would have done it on my own but still, thanks"
2007-02-10T09:34:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,ill let you know how it goes if i can get it
2007-02-10T09:40:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, i'm back
2007-02-10T09:42:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," when you use 'Connect to Server' .. the remote machine uses the credentials you supply there .. therefore, the permissions you view later are for that user"
2007-02-10T09:42:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,the user that would be sittin on-the-remote-box right?
2007-02-10T09:42:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,Flannel here let me try something brb
2007-02-10T09:42:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, yep
2007-02-10T09:43:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," it's like this -- you setup a server, can a remote user connecting to it, use his own username and password (that he setup on his box), no.. he has to be authenticated by your server"
2007-02-10T09:45:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, :)
2007-02-10T09:46:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," so, what did you have to change?"
2007-02-10T09:46:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, but didnt we already do that?
2007-02-10T09:47:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"this is what i did,   sudo nautilus..  then went to the /var/www propertires, hit permissions enabled WRITE for Other users, and thats it"
2007-02-10T09:48:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," errm, but which permissions did you change?"
2007-02-10T09:48:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, group or world/other?
2007-02-10T09:49:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"i just added write permissions on Other users, (but I reversed that)"
2007-02-10T09:50:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, i prefer you did this command -- sudo chmod -Rv 774 /var/www
2007-02-10T09:52:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid,the command i gave you should have done it
2007-02-10T09:53:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"when I made the change manually thru the graphical interface, it changed to 774. shouldnt that be the same?"
2007-02-10T09:53:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," 774 is what you want (rwxrwxr--) .. that makes the user have read/write access, the group read/write and others just read"
2007-02-10T09:56:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,its fixed
2007-02-10T09:56:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, working? write access too?
2007-02-10T09:57:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"yes i had no idea that when I added sx270 to the www-data it was working, (we pretty much set it up when we reverted the whole deletion of the commands earlier)"
2007-02-10T09:57:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"so i can read/write to that folder now, finally"
2007-02-10T09:58:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, coolies - 5 hours later (ouch) :)
2007-02-10T09:59:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,heh so thanks i appreciate it
2007-02-10T09:59:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," but yea, a lesson i have learn't today .. be extremely diligent with remote group membership"
2007-02-10T09:59:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, you're welcome :)
2007-02-10T10:00:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"i had no idea what you were doing, only found out when I noticed the users-admin was screwd, that i pretty much know"
2007-02-10T10:01:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," well, i'm not really sure which command i screwed up on -- but i have a feeling it was on one of the usermod commands where i should have used commas to seperate groups instead of spaces"
2007-02-10T10:13:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,http://66.68.242.167/chernobyl/911.wmv <- some of the stuff I was going to share with some friends :)
2007-02-10T10:14:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,was the reason for write enabling on that dir
2007-02-10T10:15:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," ok, i tried to stream that but its too slow, its downloading now :)"
2007-02-10T10:15:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"np, its my homelan  12 to 16kbps"
2007-02-10T10:16:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," yea, 14.62k :)"
2007-02-10T10:41:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, how'd you mount your ssh location locally?
2007-02-10T12:42:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," ahh no, windows permissions are much much more complex than unix ones -- they have all kinds of permissions while unix only has 3"
2007-02-10T12:43:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,and thats it right? oh good
2007-02-10T06:05:00.000Z,SurfnKid,,a remote linux box
2007-02-10T06:07:00.000Z,SurfnKid,,this is weird it doesnt let me go thru root
2007-02-10T06:08:00.000Z,SurfnKid,,"well I did a connect to.. selected SSH and put the ip of the box, then below i put username, and i put root"
2007-02-10T06:08:00.000Z,SurfnKid,,i put the password
2007-02-10T06:08:00.000Z,SurfnKid,,but didnt accept it
2007-02-10T06:08:00.000Z,SurfnKid,,ah
2007-02-10T06:09:00.000Z,SurfnKid,,"yeah, here's the reason why"
2007-02-10T06:09:00.000Z,SurfnKid,,i hate to move files to /tmp then i have to log into the remote box and move them to /var/www
2007-02-10T06:09:00.000Z,SurfnKid,,ok
2007-02-10T06:10:00.000Z,SurfnKid,,but im using nautilus to view the files
2007-02-10T06:10:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," yea, if you make your user a member of www-data (i think thats the group name) .. your user should have the right access to /var/www"
2007-02-10T06:11:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"so do i create the username im currently on, on the remote p?"
2007-02-10T06:11:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," no, just add your current username (e.g. surfnkid) to the www-data group"
2007-02-10T06:12:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,but its a remote box does tha tmatter?
2007-02-10T06:12:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,the remote box doesnt have my username
2007-02-10T06:12:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," ok, in that case -- add the user name you log into ssh with on the remote box to the www-data group (on the remote box) :)"
2007-02-10T06:12:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,ah ok that makes more sense
2007-02-10T06:13:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,i would love complete access to that remotely
2007-02-10T06:14:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," the www-data group has read/write access in that folder - if your user is a member of that group, you get those priveleges too"
2007-02-10T06:15:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, this is pretty much like windows user administration (infact micrsoft copied and enhanced the unix permissions model)
2007-02-10T06:15:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"done, added, now to try... :)"
2007-02-10T06:15:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,hah i didnt know that
2007-02-10T06:17:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"ok nothing, but here's what i did"
2007-02-10T06:18:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,added the user on the remote box to the www-blah group
2007-02-10T06:18:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, sorry for being pedantic -- but its www-data not www-blah :)
2007-02-10T06:18:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"came back to my laptop and selected  Connect to Server...  SSH, set the IP, and then the username"
2007-02-10T06:18:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,lol i mean that yeah
2007-02-10T06:19:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," errm, did you check that your user is indeed in that group now?  use  id or groups to verify"
2007-02-10T06:20:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,i went to user/groups in the menu
2007-02-10T06:21:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," yep, the www-data group only has rx permissions .. as you can see there"
2007-02-10T06:21:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,maybe i have to set the rw permissions on-that-folder
2007-02-10T06:22:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," no, its likely that those are the default permissions"
2007-02-10T06:23:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"if i change the folder permission to full access, will that enable it?"
2007-02-10T06:24:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," errm, all i think you need to do is change the ownership of the folder -- sudo sh -c 'chown www-data.www-data /var/www; chmod 774 /var/www/'"
2007-02-10T06:24:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"wow, you know this stuff well.. ok let me check something brb"
2007-02-10T06:27:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, you should know that the other directories and files within /var/www/* will still retain the old permissions -- jsut to make you aware
2007-02-10T06:28:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"oh right, kind of like parent/child perm"
2007-02-10T06:28:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, exactly :)
2007-02-10T06:29:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, it shoudlnt cause any problems for the time being -- but just be aware incase you do have problems
2007-02-10T06:30:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,well yeah i do need child access i have 2 folders which are specifically the ones i need access to
2007-02-10T06:31:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, sudo sh -c 'chown -R www-data.www-data /var/www; chmod -R 774 /var/www/'
2007-02-10T06:31:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,ok let me try that
2007-02-10T06:33:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,hmm now my permissions are denied
2007-02-10T06:34:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,after running sudo sh -c 'chown -R www-data.www-data /var/www;  chmod -R 774 /var/www/'
2007-02-10T06:35:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, permissions denied on what?
2007-02-10T06:35:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,to enter/view the folder
2007-02-10T06:36:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," ok, can you pastebin this -- sudo ls -ld /var/www"
2007-02-10T06:37:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,drwxrwxr-- 5 www-data www-data 4096 2007-01-31 04:48 /var/www
2007-02-10T06:38:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," ok, this too --  whoami; id;"
2007-02-10T06:39:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,http://www.pastebin.ca/348225
2007-02-10T06:41:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, if you look at the output of id -- www-data is not among them .. which explains why you cant list that directory
2007-02-10T06:42:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,:/ so then do i add www-data to another group?
2007-02-10T06:45:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, run this command on the remote machine - sudo usermod -G www-data $USER
2007-02-10T06:47:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"i did, returned nothing"
2007-02-10T06:47:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"tried to view the /var/www folder, nothing"
2007-02-10T06:47:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, that indicates successs -- verify group membership with id
2007-02-10T06:47:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,gotcha
2007-02-10T06:49:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"um i cant do anything, I cant get into user/groups how do i get back the access?"
2007-02-10T06:50:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid,what does the id command return?
2007-02-10T06:51:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,just --- id ?
2007-02-10T06:51:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, yep
2007-02-10T06:52:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,http://www.pastebin.ca/348235
2007-02-10T06:53:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," errm, still no change -- have you tried logging off and logging back in?"
2007-02-10T06:53:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,that could help right :)
2007-02-10T06:53:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, indeed
2007-02-10T06:56:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,now i should run id ?
2007-02-10T06:56:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,let me see
2007-02-10T06:56:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"uid=1000(sx270) gid=1000(sx270) grupos=33(www-data),1000(sx270)"
2007-02-10T06:57:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," ok, hold tight -- i'm coming to the rescue :)"
2007-02-10T06:57:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,ok np
2007-02-10T07:02:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," ok, first command - sudo usermod -G $USER"
2007-02-10T07:03:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, second command : for i in adm dialout cdrom floppy audio dip video plugdev lpadmin scanner admin sx270; do echo sudo usermod -g $i; done
2007-02-10T07:03:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid,correction ..  second command : for i in adm dialout cdrom floppy audio dip video plugdev lpadmin scanner admin sx270; do sudo usermod -g $i; done
2007-02-10T07:07:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, do you want the command again? let me know if you do :)
2007-02-10T07:10:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,could you pm the commands separately plz i got confused
2007-02-10T07:10:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," ok, coming up"
2007-02-10T07:11:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid,  sudo usermod -G $USER;  for i in adm dialout cdrom floppy audio dip video plugdev lpadmin scanner admin sx270; do sudo usermod -g $i; done
2007-02-10T07:11:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," oops, hold on"
2007-02-10T07:11:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid,  sudo usermod -G $USER $USER;  for i in adm dialout cdrom floppy audio dip video plugdev lpadmin scanner admin sx270; do sudo usermod -g $i; done
2007-02-10T07:15:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,should have a pm there waiting
2007-02-10T07:16:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid,i was just going to ask how it was going -- i got no PM (are you registered on these servers?)
2007-02-10T07:16:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,yeah hmmm
2007-02-10T07:17:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,argh now i am
2007-02-10T07:17:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, i just sent you two pms
2007-02-10T07:18:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,me too lol
2007-02-10T07:18:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, looks good so far -- one last command -- sudo usermod -g www-data $USER
2007-02-10T07:19:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop, ok
2007-02-10T07:19:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,i get perm. denied
2007-02-10T07:19:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"well it didnt return anything, but couldnt get into the /var/www folder"
2007-02-10T07:20:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, log off and log back on -- it should work now
2007-02-10T07:20:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,was about to do that :) brb
2007-02-10T07:24:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"ok done.. i checked to see if i could enter into the user/group settings, but its not in the menu"
2007-02-10T07:24:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,how do i get that back?
2007-02-10T07:25:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, aren't you logging in to the remote machine via SSH ?
2007-02-10T07:26:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"sure, but it is also being used"
2007-02-10T07:26:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, so you using X over ssh?
2007-02-10T07:26:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,if i understand that correctly yes
2007-02-10T07:27:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," ok, errm, what happens when you type this at the command line -- gksudo users-admin ?"
2007-02-10T07:27:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,im not too familiar with the whole X over ssh yet :P
2007-02-10T07:27:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," well, i just had to make sure that you are working on the remote machine and not on the local one :p"
2007-02-10T07:28:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"oh right, nah im on the remote one. i ran it and returned it got an error, i couldnt execute this task"
2007-02-10T07:29:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, whats the exact error?
2007-02-10T07:29:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,can you set it back to the way it was maybe my idea isnt supported since its X over ssh
2007-02-10T07:29:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"its in spanish, ill try to translate ' Cant Execute users-admin'"
2007-02-10T07:30:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"big red Prohibited sign, says' the mechanism for authorization does not allow to execute this program, Contact the System Administrator'"
2007-02-10T07:30:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, effectively all i have done is add your user to the www-data groups -- i did screw up with usermod but then i restored your group membership - i'm trying now to ascertain why you arent able to see menu items
2007-02-10T07:31:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, are you sure you are using 'gksudo' there?    gksudo users-admin ?
2007-02-10T07:31:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"can you reverse the www-data command that was put on earlier, maybe if i put it back itll all be back to normal"
2007-02-10T07:31:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,yeah gksudo
2007-02-10T07:32:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, the www-data group shouldnt have bearing on this -- can you paste the output of id again to verify that the commands i gave you did indeed run
2007-02-10T07:33:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,sure no probs hang on
2007-02-10T07:35:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,check pm
2007-02-10T07:35:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," ohh ouch, i just closed that tab .. paste again please :p"
2007-02-10T07:35:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, i had some output from you there but wasnt sure if it was from a previous paste :)
2007-02-10T07:36:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"yeah had a previous VT still logged on, was not aware of it"
2007-02-10T07:36:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,check Surfnkid   not SurfnKid_
2007-02-10T07:36:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," yea, got it -- hmm, that output's not right again -- hold on :p :)"
2007-02-10T07:38:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," sudo usermod -G adm,dialout,cdrom,floppy,audio,dip,video,plugdev,lpadmin,scanner,admin,sx270 $USER"
2007-02-10T07:39:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"done, didnt return anything  log out?"
2007-02-10T07:40:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," yea, to be safe"
2007-02-10T07:40:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,okies
2007-02-10T07:42:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"logged back in and checked the menus, they are still not all visible"
2007-02-10T07:43:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, bahh ..these kids arent helping either -- paste id again please
2007-02-10T07:44:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,sure
2007-02-10T07:45:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"uid=1000(sx270) gid=1000(sx270) grupos=33(www-data),1000(sx270)"
2007-02-10T07:48:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,doesnt look like it changed
2007-02-10T07:48:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," yea, try it again - sudo usermod -G adm,dialout,cdrom,floppy,audio,dip,video,plugdev,lpadmin,scanner,admin,sx270 $USER"
2007-02-10T07:50:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,nothing
2007-02-10T07:50:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,the menu isnt visible
2007-02-10T07:51:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, but does the command succeed?
2007-02-10T07:51:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,still cant execute
2007-02-10T07:51:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"oh wait, i need sudo dont i?"
2007-02-10T07:51:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid,it's sudo that needs to succeed
2007-02-10T07:52:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,hmmm do i run sudo gksudo users-admin though?
2007-02-10T07:52:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"oh i get what you mean, cuz im on the GUI"
2007-02-10T07:52:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, gksudo users-admin should be enough
2007-02-10T07:53:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, gksudo is the GUI equivalent to sudo
2007-02-10T07:53:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,yeah i just remembered
2007-02-10T07:53:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," ok, well, i was interested in how the sudo usermod .. command fared really?"
2007-02-10T07:54:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"hmm well it doesnt return anything once i enter the command, just returns the prompt"
2007-02-10T07:55:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, and this command is  'gksudo users-admin' ?? the one that just returns to the prompt?
2007-02-10T07:55:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"oh no i mean, the usermod admin and all that stuff with $USER at the end. that returns me to the prompt, then i enter gksudo users-admin and I get a window with the same cant execute this task error"
2007-02-10T07:56:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," hmm, thats so odd, because if the command succeeds, the group membership should have changed"
2007-02-10T07:56:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,oh wait sx270 is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.
2007-02-10T07:56:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid,youch.. :| not good
2007-02-10T07:57:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,yea i noticed well so how can it be set back? sx270 is the admin account
2007-02-10T07:58:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid,"this is not good at all, to use sudo, you need to be in the admin group .. but thats not the case now :("
2007-02-10T07:58:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,so im pretty much in an unadministratible system
2007-02-10T07:59:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," I'm so sorry if I did this (it wasnt intentional) ,, you should be able to boot into recovery mode and edit the /etc/groups file using nano -- quick things to do"
2007-02-10T08:00:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"well thats a solution, its not all lost :)"
2007-02-10T08:00:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,i thought it was all lost
2007-02-10T08:00:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," well unadministerable only from the current runlevel .. if you get to runlevel 1, it's recoverable"
2007-02-10T08:00:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,cables ok brb let me try to get into safe mode with my wifi card
2007-02-10T08:00:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,wicked brb
2007-02-10T08:00:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, i dunno how that happened -- but i must be to blame .. i'm terribly sorry
2007-02-10T08:01:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"its ok at least you know, many just run off lol"
2007-02-10T08:02:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, but you're in a fix here arent you? isnt this machine at a remote location?
2007-02-10T08:05:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, was this the driver for this machine or the remote one?
2007-02-10T08:05:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"oh no im on the remote machine, the one with the /var/www issue, its the wifi driver, it uses the wlan-ng prism driver, i thought wasnt going to load it, it did :)"
2007-02-10T08:06:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"im on recovery mode <on the box, yes the remote box>"
2007-02-10T08:07:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," i'm a little confused about your setup (but i'll not focus on it now) what matters is restoring the groups again -- so you in recovery mode, you got root access there?"
2007-02-10T08:07:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"yes, i mean im on the remote box, cuz its right across the room, since we were talking about my laptop=client  www=remote"
2007-02-10T08:08:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,im on recovery mode
2007-02-10T08:08:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,although it might be hard to copy and paste stuff
2007-02-10T08:08:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," oohh cool, i thought remote box as in halfway across a city or something like that :)"
2007-02-10T08:08:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"oh hell no, i would be having cpr by now"
2007-02-10T08:08:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," no no, all we need to do is edit the /etc/groups file"
2007-02-10T08:09:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,might want to pm that
2007-02-10T08:09:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid,ok
2007-02-10T08:10:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, you recving pms?
2007-02-10T08:10:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,hmm nope
2007-02-10T08:10:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid,ping me
2007-02-10T08:11:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,i pinged
2007-02-10T08:11:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,hmm
2007-02-10T08:11:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," no luck .. anyway, lets not waste time there - i have to go in a bit, but before that i have to see you online and happy"
2007-02-10T08:12:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid,you got root access at that terminal right? just making sure?
2007-02-10T08:12:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,yes!
2007-02-10T08:12:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid,nano /etc/groups
2007-02-10T08:12:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,yeah it says
2007-02-10T08:13:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,root@sx270
2007-02-10T08:13:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,this is gonna be hard with only one window
2007-02-10T08:13:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,but ill try
2007-02-10T08:14:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," find your usergroup in that file -- and add this to the end of the line -  sx270,adm,dialout,cdrom,floppy,audio,dip,video,plugdev,lpadmin,scanner,admin,www-data"
2007-02-10T08:14:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,could i use vim instead?
2007-02-10T08:14:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," if you are comfortable with vim sure? infact i'd use it, but not many others know how to use it"
2007-02-10T08:15:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"yeah cuz im not used to nano, ok ill get on vim"
2007-02-10T08:15:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,did you mean /etc/group
2007-02-10T08:15:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, nano really needs no getting used to  -- but vim users tend to find themselves typing ':wq' all over the place :)
2007-02-10T08:16:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,haha yeah with ! too
2007-02-10T08:16:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," ahh yea, /etc/group  -- typo"
2007-02-10T08:16:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,so find my usergroup file hang on
2007-02-10T08:17:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,ta heck is my usergroup file
2007-02-10T08:17:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,whats it named?
2007-02-10T08:17:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, sx27  i think
2007-02-10T08:18:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"oh wait sorry i see it now, its got a www-data at the end of it"
2007-02-10T08:18:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"there's 3 other users below it, but they have nothing after the :"
2007-02-10T08:19:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,do i just remove the www-data?
2007-02-10T08:19:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," ok, remove the www-data at the end of the line and add this in its place - adm,dialout,cdrom,floppy,audio,dip,video,plugdev,lpadmin,scanner,admin,www-data"
2007-02-10T08:20:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"question, how do i switch from window to window using screen?"
2007-02-10T08:21:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,how can i switch screens  when using screen
2007-02-10T08:21:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," screen, not too sure, errm, ctrl+z to background this window -- jobs -l to list jobs and fg %1 or fg %2 to bring other jobs into the foreground"
2007-02-10T08:22:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,hang on so i can get the command right
2007-02-10T08:27:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,oops sorry it rebooted
2007-02-10T08:28:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," edit /etc/group -- and add this to the end of your usergroup's line - adm,dialout,cdrom,floppy,audio,dip,video,plugdev,lpadmin,scanner,admin,www-data"
2007-02-10T08:31:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,ok up to www-data right?
2007-02-10T08:31:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,gonna add it hang on a sec
2007-02-10T08:31:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, yeop
2007-02-10T08:35:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"ok im back on normal mode, i went ahead and tried to get gksudo users-admin and it still says the same thing"
2007-02-10T08:35:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,doesnt allow me in
2007-02-10T08:35:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, what does id list?
2007-02-10T08:36:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,i was supposed to enter adm... all that next to my usergroup sx270 right?
2007-02-10T08:36:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid,it doesnt look like the edit was saved -- or it wasnt saved properly
2007-02-10T08:36:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, can you pastebin /etc/group please
2007-02-10T08:37:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,http://www.pastebin.ca/348336
2007-02-10T08:38:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"dont i have to add sx270 next to every place that says oscasr, internet ?"
2007-02-10T08:39:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, not really -- your username is sx27 right?
2007-02-10T08:40:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, this is real perplexing -- pastebin the output of this  -- whoami; id; groups;
2007-02-10T08:41:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,http://www.pastebin.ca/348341
2007-02-10T08:42:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"you had it right once, didnt you put back all the users with one of the usermod commands or something of that kind>?"
2007-02-10T08:43:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, yea it was alright -- next thing i know you have only these 2 groups -- and now i cant understand why /etc/group says one thing and id says another
2007-02-10T08:43:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, are you sure you saved the file as /etc/group ??
2007-02-10T08:44:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,ill check
2007-02-10T08:45:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"sure did, but i pressed Ctrl + D to continue booting, should i do a full reboot maybe thatll help"
2007-02-10T08:45:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,Esc  wq! saved it
2007-02-10T08:46:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,let me reboot
2007-02-10T08:46:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," yea, a reboot would definitely help :)"
2007-02-10T08:56:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,ok i did something of my own and added sx270 to the root section at the very top
2007-02-10T08:56:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,now i have users/groups on the menu
2007-02-10T08:56:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, and do you have all the default groups back in too?
2007-02-10T08:56:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, because thats what matters really
2007-02-10T08:56:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"i practically added sx270 where i thought would be needed, also in the sudo usermod"
2007-02-10T08:57:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"wow now i do user/groups from the menu and i dont even get a password, i would like to get the password verification back"
2007-02-10T08:58:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," if you just issued a command using sudo/gksudo, you will not have been prompted for a password, that is normal and expected"
2007-02-10T08:58:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, did you use a sudo command?
2007-02-10T08:58:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"actually i didnt, i chose the ubuntu menu"
2007-02-10T08:59:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, did you issue any commands at all prior to this?
2007-02-10T09:02:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,http://pastebin.ca/348357
2007-02-10T09:04:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,brb
2007-02-10T09:05:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,rebooting one more time
2007-02-10T09:10:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,is gone
2007-02-10T09:11:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, you also have your usergroup in root :o
2007-02-10T09:11:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,yeah i removed it now
2007-02-10T09:11:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, no wonder you werent prompted for a password -- because you are effectively root there
2007-02-10T09:11:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"actually it wasnt root, it was sudo"
2007-02-10T09:12:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,man i just learned stuff about admin access that is good to know!
2007-02-10T09:12:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," err ,... not from what i see here  http://pastebin.ca/348357"
2007-02-10T09:12:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"oh right, but i removed it now"
2007-02-10T09:12:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, line #1 has your usergroup in root .. dont do that
2007-02-10T09:12:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,yeah now i wont
2007-02-10T09:12:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," ok, so now whats the status of your id command? :)"
2007-02-10T09:12:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,let me check
2007-02-10T09:12:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, I hope its all good
2007-02-10T09:13:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"it is, i can now do everything as before, just needed to get the gksudo users-admin like you said back up"
2007-02-10T09:14:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, also dont forget access to /var/www :)
2007-02-10T09:14:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,lol oh yeah thats what i came in here for! http://pastebin.ca/348364
2007-02-10T09:14:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,at least i learned something new about /etc/group today
2007-02-10T09:15:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, looking good so far -- your group membership looks intact
2007-02-10T09:15:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,which one the sx270?
2007-02-10T09:15:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, you should be able to do this without a hitch now -- cd /var/www; ls -l;
2007-02-10T09:16:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,here's the /etc/group file now that i removed sudo and root http://pastebin.ca/348367
2007-02-10T09:16:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"yup, i can browse, just need to make sure I can access this box thru X over on my laptop so i can copy files directly to /var/www/*"
2007-02-10T09:16:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, whoa .. you've practically made yourself a member of every group in /etc/group -- now thats not good either
2007-02-10T09:17:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"yeah thats what i noticed to lol, help me out here, give me a list of which ones I need to be part of"
2007-02-10T09:17:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," this should be enough -- adm,dialout,cdrom,floppy,audio,dip,video,plugdev,lpadmin,scanner,admin,www-data"
2007-02-10T09:18:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"hmm interesting, im not part of some of those!"
2007-02-10T09:19:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"so remove the ones i put,replace with urs. ok hang a sec"
2007-02-10T09:19:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, these are the groups you were in before we got into this mess :)
2007-02-10T09:19:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"ah, ok thats exactly what i need back"
2007-02-10T09:20:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"ok done, gonna reboot see if it made a difference"
2007-02-10T09:21:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," hah, ok :)"
2007-02-10T09:21:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"thats the only thing that changed, nothing else"
2007-02-10T09:21:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,lets hope i can do gksudo users-admin :) brb
2007-02-10T09:26:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"looks good, i can now go into the menu select user/group asks me for password, like it should have, so i think we're good, at least I learned where the main group file is in case I ever do something I shouldnt"
2007-02-10T09:26:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," okies, looks good then -- now to your original thing -- access to /var/www"
2007-02-10T09:27:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,i guess i can do that from the /var/www folder permissions right?
2007-02-10T09:27:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,or should i use gksudo users-group
2007-02-10T09:27:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, do how you originally wanted to do it .. ssh to the remote box -- ls -l /var/www
2007-02-10T09:29:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"ok here's how i do it, from my laptop i do Connect to Server...  enter the IP, and i get access to it. Also I do use ssh at times via Terminal but i can manage copying files from there, I just really want to copy 2 3 4 or 10 files directly from my desktop to the /var/www folder thru nautilus"
2007-02-10T09:29:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,and nautilus sees the /var/www on the remote box
2007-02-10T09:30:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, well the fact you see /var/www through nautilus is promising -- i'm sure you'd be able to copy files across too
2007-02-10T09:30:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"i can see it, but cant write to it, only /tmp can be written to, do you think maybe if I set perm on the /var/www it would allow me to?"
2007-02-10T09:32:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"hmm, permissions are disabled, i cant change them, i wonder why"
2007-02-10T09:32:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," errm, you could check the permissions on it yes -- ls -ld /var/www; ls -l /var/www"
2007-02-10T09:32:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," ok, im gonna get a cuppa coffee and something to munch on -- i need a source of energy :)"
2007-02-10T09:32:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,ok sure
2007-02-10T09:33:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"at least you helped me thru, and i thank you for that, i would have to have researched how to get back, probably would have done it on my own but still, thanks"
2007-02-10T09:34:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,ill let you know how it goes if i can get it
2007-02-10T09:40:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, i'm back
2007-02-10T09:42:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," when you use 'Connect to Server' .. the remote machine uses the credentials you supply there .. therefore, the permissions you view later are for that user"
2007-02-10T09:42:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,the user that would be sittin on-the-remote-box right?
2007-02-10T09:42:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,Flannel here let me try something brb
2007-02-10T09:42:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, yep
2007-02-10T09:43:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," it's like this -- you setup a server, can a remote user connecting to it, use his own username and password (that he setup on his box), no.. he has to be authenticated by your server"
2007-02-10T09:45:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, :)
2007-02-10T09:46:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," so, what did you have to change?"
2007-02-10T09:46:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, but didnt we already do that?
2007-02-10T09:47:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"this is what i did,   sudo nautilus..  then went to the /var/www propertires, hit permissions enabled WRITE for Other users, and thats it"
2007-02-10T09:48:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," errm, but which permissions did you change?"
2007-02-10T09:48:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, group or world/other?
2007-02-10T09:49:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"i just added write permissions on Other users, (but I reversed that)"
2007-02-10T09:50:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, i prefer you did this command -- sudo chmod -Rv 774 /var/www
2007-02-10T09:52:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid,the command i gave you should have done it
2007-02-10T09:53:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"when I made the change manually thru the graphical interface, it changed to 774. shouldnt that be the same?"
2007-02-10T09:53:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid," 774 is what you want (rwxrwxr--) .. that makes the user have read/write access, the group read/write and others just read"
2007-02-10T09:56:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,its fixed
2007-02-10T09:56:00.000Z,unop,SurfnKid, working? write access too?
2007-02-10T09:57:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"yes i had no idea that when I added sx270 to the www-data it was working, (we pretty much set it up when we reverted the whole deletion of the commands earlier)"
2007-02-10T09:57:00.000Z,SurfnKid,unop,"so i can read/write to that folder now, finally"
