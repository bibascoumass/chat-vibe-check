2005-06-01T15:49:00.000Z,dooglus,,how do I list the files in a package?
2005-06-01T15:50:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,try dpkg -L <packagename>
2005-06-01T15:51:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,assuming it's installed
2005-06-01T15:51:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,then I think you would need apt-file
2005-06-01T15:54:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,heh - thoreauputic
2005-06-01T15:55:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I guess your client is highlighting the line
2005-06-01T15:57:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,change your irssi theme so you can read things ;)
2005-06-01T15:58:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I'm stuck with it now since that is how I'm known
2005-06-01T16:02:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"seriously, change your irssi theme ;)"
2005-06-01T16:03:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,you might need to read someone's long or short <yellow-dude>
2005-06-01T16:03:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,hrm - lots of docs on irssi.org
2005-06-02T07:09:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"some say gnomebaker, others like graveman"
2005-06-02T07:58:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,topyli (I think) suggested ` sudo chmod -x /usr/bin/esd`
2005-06-02T07:58:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I've done it and it seems to be working well here :)
2005-06-02T07:59:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"(I can see your name now that I've changed the background to black and the foreground to white) I think I still need esd for some programs (like totem?) - but according to that RestrictedFormats wiki page, you can ask esd to back off when it's not active"
2005-06-02T08:00:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,hmm - I use totem-xine
2005-06-02T08:00:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,works fine that way
2005-06-02T08:00:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,also I used the suggestions for fixing sound on http://ubuntuguide.org
2005-06-02T08:03:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,thanks.  i hadn't heard of that site before.  looks good!
2005-06-02T08:03:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"yes, it's a one - stop shop, pretty much :)"
2005-06-02T08:04:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"I don't agree with all of it , but it seems pretty sound in general"
2005-06-02T08:27:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,how did you install the 686 kernel?  I don't see a package in synaptic for it
2005-06-02T08:28:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,it's there: apt-cache search linux-image
2005-06-02T08:28:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"heh.  'linux-image', not 'kernel-2.6.something-686'?  odd that the kernel doesn't have 'kernel' in its package name, wouldn't you say?"
2005-06-02T08:29:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"well, linux is the kernel - the rest is the OS ( talk to Richard Stallman *grin*)"
2005-06-02T08:30:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"I know, and that's fair enough."
2005-06-02T08:31:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,GNU/BSD/Ubuntu/Debian Linux *smile*
2005-06-02T08:41:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,does fuser /dev/snd/*   show the devices in use?
2005-06-02T08:42:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,do you mean 'fuser -c'?
2005-06-02T08:43:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,?
2005-06-02T08:43:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,the command you told me doesn't print any output.
2005-06-02T08:43:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,but if I use the '-c' flag I see a lot of output
2005-06-02T08:44:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"oh, I see...  -c means to show all processes using all files on the same device as those devices..."
2005-06-02T08:45:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"if I play some music, then your fuser command shows that the mplayer is using /dev/snd/pcmC0D0p and /dev/snd/timer"
2005-06-02T08:45:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"and if I stop the music player, fuser shows that nothing is using the devices"
2005-06-02T08:45:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,you can play sound then?
2005-06-02T08:45:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"I can play sounds, but I can't hear them..."
2005-06-02T08:45:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"that's logical, is it not?"
2005-06-02T08:46:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,it's as if my ears stopped working.  ubuntu tells me they're playing.
2005-06-02T08:47:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,hmm... I find killing everything sound related and restarting alsa sometimes resurrects sound
2005-06-02T08:48:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,without alsa you won'r hear a thing
2005-06-02T08:48:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,maybe I need to run alsa then...  what's the command?
2005-06-02T08:49:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,all the other bits like OSS need alsa as well in 2.6.* kernels
2005-06-02T08:50:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"I see 'shutting down ALSA - ok; setting up ALSA - ok' - but still 'ps -ef | grep -i alsa' shows nothing, and still my ears tell me that nothing's playing"
2005-06-02T08:51:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,alsa won't show up like that on your ps command
2005-06-02T08:51:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I'm playing music here and alsa doesn't figure in that output
2005-06-02T08:52:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,run alsamixer and use m
2005-06-02T08:52:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,do what bob2 and I suggested
2005-06-02T08:53:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,hahah
2005-06-02T08:54:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,you have a new weapon in your arsenal :)
2005-06-02T08:54:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"I never saw 'alsamixer' before, in all my Mandrake/Mandriva/CentOS days"
2005-06-02T08:54:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,it's well hidden ;)
2005-06-02T08:55:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"like a lot of other utilities, you only find them by living in the cli for a while"
2005-06-02T08:56:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"it's funny you mentioned 'Your Arsenal'.  It's the name of a Morrissey CD.  The track I was using to test the sound, in fact the only .mp3 I have on this computer was a Morrissey track."
2005-06-02T08:57:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"I'm psychic, evidently ;-)"
2005-06-06T15:21:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"people's mileage seems to vary a lot with media players, I've noticed"
2005-06-07T07:52:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,why?
2005-06-07T07:53:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"versioning problems, broken updates etc"
2005-06-07T07:53:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,much grief for many when they upgraded to Hoary
2005-06-07T07:55:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"I never tried it, was interested to hear why you don't recommend it.  thanks."
2005-06-07T07:55:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"what *would* you recommend as a temporary source to get, say, win32 codecs?"
2005-06-07T07:56:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I used marillat testing - but I commented it out right away after I got the codecs
2005-06-07T08:00:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I think they should live in /usr/lib/win32 as Fator_Dee says
2005-06-07T08:01:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"oh, ok"
2005-06-07T08:04:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,that worked - I made a new directory /usr/lib/win32 and moved them all in there
2005-06-07T08:04:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,aha ! :D
2005-06-07T08:05:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"amongst other things, ..."
2005-06-07T08:08:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,funny that SiS7012 is on irq 11 _ I think mine is on 18
2005-06-07T08:08:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"that's the sound card, right?"
2005-06-07T08:09:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,yes
2005-06-07T08:09:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,do 'cat /proc/interrupts' to see the IRQs
2005-06-07T08:10:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,18:    3690083   IO-APIC-level  SiS SI7012
2005-06-08T07:10:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,your 'wget http://nick-zap.home.comcast.net/stuff/unix.pdf| xpdf' command has a couple of problems
2005-06-08T07:10:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,OK - I just thought it would work: i guess the pipe doesn't
2005-06-08T07:11:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,thanks for the correction
2005-06-08T07:11:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,you can 'wget -O- http:/...' if you want to write to stdout
2005-06-08T07:11:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,but I don't know if xpdf can read a document from a pipe anyway
2005-06-08T08:01:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"right click, properties, open with"
2005-06-08T08:02:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"I can do that, but it doesn't seem to offer me any option to 'always use this app by default in future'"
2005-06-08T08:03:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"properties, open with , add, check the one you want"
2005-06-08T08:04:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"I can see 'open with', but not 'add'"
2005-06-08T08:04:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,'properties' at the bottom - choose the 'open with' tab
2005-06-08T08:05:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I think you are in the wrong dialog
2005-06-08T08:05:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"after right click, go to the bottom entry (properties)"
2005-06-08T08:06:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,ok.  i see.  that seems to have hung nautilus though
2005-06-08T08:07:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,hmm - odd
2005-06-08T08:07:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,half an hour ago it told me that nautilus had crashed and asked if I wanted to inform the developers.  but then it got better again.
2005-06-08T08:08:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"I use rox filer here, mostly (I don't like nautilus much and I'm currently using fluxbox, not gnome)"
2005-06-08T08:09:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"I've never liked gnome much.  First impressions with ubuntu were that finally it was stable, but it seems not to be the case really."
2005-06-08T08:10:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,it's OK - I'm happier with fluxbox or xfce4 personally
2005-06-08T10:38:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,sudo apt-get install apt-howto
2005-06-08T10:38:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,but it's fairly detailed
2005-06-08T10:38:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,I like that.  using 'apt' to learn about apt...  :)
2005-06-08T10:38:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,I like details.  It's vagueness I don't like.  :)
2005-06-08T10:56:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,heh - 'It's a Family channel' ;)
2005-06-08T10:59:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,it tends to choke
2005-06-08T10:59:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"I've had better luck with amarok (KDE app, of course, though)"
2005-06-08T11:00:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,hmm - ideology or experience?
2005-06-08T11:00:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,amarok was pretty good - it coped with all my mp3 files
2005-06-08T11:01:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"neither.  I've nothing against KDE, but I just think it makes sense not to mix GTK and KDE apps, for the sake of memory conservation"
2005-06-08T11:01:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I think amarok is the best I've tried so far - but I often just start up xmms or beep-media-player from a directory or use streamtuner
2005-06-08T11:08:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,mono
2005-06-08T11:09:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,verb?
2005-06-08T11:10:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,um - I meant 'mono not .NET' but I guess you knew that
2005-06-08T11:10:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"ok, i see."
2005-06-08T11:14:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,otherwise the answer as always is '42' ;-)
2005-06-08T11:24:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,hmm... the java trap in action then :/
2005-06-08T11:25:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"yes, but...  it's SO pretty...  and SO functional!"
2005-06-08T11:47:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,heh - install some xmms skins right away!
2005-06-08T11:47:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,or winamp skins if that's your thing...
2005-06-08T11:47:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,xmms skins work with beep-media-player?
2005-06-08T11:47:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,yup
2005-06-08T11:58:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,shift-drag
2005-06-08T11:58:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,should snap to the edge in gnome
2005-06-08T12:39:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"yeah, I wish I could find that info too"
2005-06-08T12:40:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"I guess it's user, system, nice, idle, then - um - 'wait'?  and as for 'hi' and 'si' I have no idea"
2005-06-08T12:40:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"yes, the first few seem pretty clear at least"
2005-06-08T12:41:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,my 'wa' shows zero here
2005-06-08T12:42:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"I think mine is usually zero, but I'm running an 'updatedb' with my huge external drive mounted."
2005-06-08T12:42:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,hmm... w_   access ? Guessing...
2005-06-08T14:14:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,is this warty or hoary? Hoary should give you your country code
2005-06-08T14:15:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"this is hoary.  I told it my country when I installed, but it set my up using the .com address..."
2005-06-08T14:16:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,how should hoary give me my country code?  I'm not sure I follow you.
2005-06-08T14:16:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"crimsun is right -  CC.archive.ubuntu.com, where CC is the country code"
2005-06-08T14:16:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,mine is au so au is prepended
2005-06-08T14:17:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,does that make sense?
2005-06-08T14:18:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"sorry, I was away, hunting the slivovice"
2005-06-08T14:18:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,I understand.  but should hoary have put the 'cz.' in for me?  or am I expected to know that I have to put it there?
2005-06-08T14:19:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,my understanding is thet it should be put in for you
2005-06-08T14:19:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,mine was put in automatically
2005-06-08T14:19:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,that's strange then.
2005-06-08T14:20:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"hmm - maybe there is no cz sever address, I don't know"
2005-06-08T14:32:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,what do you see if you run 'grep hoary-security /etc/apt/sources.list' please?
2005-06-08T14:33:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,because: 'unknown host au.security.ubuntu.com'
2005-06-08T14:33:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I get 4 lines
2005-06-08T14:34:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,what are the hostnames?
2005-06-08T14:34:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I can paste in #flood if you care to look
2005-06-08T14:55:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"as bob2 said, it ends up at  ge-0-0.access8.lon2.mnet.net.uk via the US - funny !"
2005-06-08T14:55:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,so the au sever is in the UK - what a joke
2005-06-08T14:55:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,so I'm going to use ubuntu.cz instead...  that doesn't go via several oceans...
2005-06-08T14:55:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,I guess you should pick a source from http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/Archive
2005-06-08T14:56:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,what *are* they thinking?
2005-06-08T14:56:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,indeed
2005-06-10T09:07:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,there's a 'sensor' command I seem to recall
2005-06-10T09:07:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,hmm..maybe not
2005-06-10T10:24:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,consider doing 'set -o noclobber' in your .bashrc - then you can't accidentally lose stuff by doing '>' instead of '>>'
2005-06-10T10:24:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,it's Ok - I didn't clobber anything as it was a test: but good point
2005-06-10T10:25:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,next time you might not be so lucky :)
2005-06-10T10:25:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,indeed
2005-06-10T10:25:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,thanks :)
2005-06-11T11:51:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,dist-upgrade
2005-06-13T08:50:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,you X link is quite amusing :)
2005-06-13T08:51:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,I'm reading it too.  He's quite angry :)
2005-06-13T08:51:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"it's an old piece, but still pretty much true today."
2005-06-13T10:01:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,you might want to read that URL
2005-06-13T10:02:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,ubotu's
2005-06-13T10:09:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"thanks, but I think that's the link which got my into this mess in the first place..."
2005-06-13T10:10:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"oh, sorry - it worked for me fine :/"
2005-06-13T07:57:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,for a rough estimste cd to /var/cache /apt/archives and try ' for each in *.deb ; do du -h $each ; done '
2005-06-13T07:58:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,assuming you haven't cleared your apt cache of course
2005-06-13T08:04:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"I was being a bit silly... synaptic allows me to just list installed packages, and to sort by size...  duh!"
2005-06-13T08:04:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,ah - much easier ! :)
2005-06-13T08:05:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I just did mine and discovered for some reason a lot of debs have been cleared from my cache without my asking: this isn't very Debianish - I expected all to be there! Odd...
2005-06-13T08:06:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,I'm sure I saw somewhere that the cache is cleared of anything over 7 days old?
2005-06-13T08:06:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I'll google... but on debian I seem to recall this didn't happen
2005-06-13T08:08:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"the apt-get clean command is supposed to clear the cache explicitly, I thought"
2005-06-13T10:08:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,the main trouble isn't rpm so much as the weird variety of different rms
2005-06-13T10:08:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,there's only one rms!
2005-06-13T10:09:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,like SUSE and Mandriva are  not compatible with Redhat
2005-06-13T10:09:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,sorry typo ;)
2005-06-13T10:11:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"yes, but a Mandriva RPM won't necessarily work on SUSE, for example"
2005-06-14T12:58:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"it would speed up performance if he compiled his own packages, surely?"
2005-06-14T12:59:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"well, i encourage the use of Ubuntu packages, because I don't want to hold people's hands whem they break their package management"
2005-06-14T13:01:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"but i guess that's presumptuous of me, so yaeh"
2005-06-14T13:13:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,there is ntpdate (which is the thing you saw) and an ntpdate daemon (which isn't installed by default)
2005-06-14T13:14:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"aah, i see."
2005-06-20T11:50:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,no worries:)
2005-09-25T14:37:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,you might want to try installing deborphan
2005-09-25T14:37:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,might I?
2005-09-25T14:38:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"well, deborphan will find orphaned packages :)"
2005-09-25T14:38:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"ooh, that sounds good."
2005-09-25T14:46:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,thanks for suggesting deborphan.  that helped a lot
2005-09-25T14:47:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,you're welcome :)
2005-09-25T15:09:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,you built a deb for it?
2005-09-25T15:09:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,I did.  I ran 'make-kpkg --initrd --revision=cim.2.6.12.1 kernel_image' like the readme told me to.
2005-09-25T15:10:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,is it in /var/cache/apt/archives ?
2005-09-25T15:10:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,aha
2005-09-25T15:10:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,I clean the cache regularly
2005-09-25T15:10:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,OK
2005-09-25T15:11:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,but you just discovered that the system believed you when you named it kernel-image *grin*
2005-09-25T15:12:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,you should suggest this as a way to reduce confusion among new users ;-)
2005-09-25T15:13:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,my 6 'virtual consoles' are all black on black too.
2005-09-25T15:13:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,ah - not so good
2005-09-25T15:13:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,setterm might help...
2005-09-25T15:14:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"well, your new kernel is entertaining at least :)"
2005-09-25T15:15:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,man setterm *evil grin*
2005-09-25T15:17:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,setterm doesn't seem to have any effect on the VCs
2005-09-25T15:17:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,oh. Is your /etc/inittab normal looking?
2005-09-25T15:18:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"I have 2 kernels installed - the regular breezy one, and the one I built myself.  One has working VCs, the other doesn't.  So it can't be anything about /etc/inittab, right?  Or vga= options.  Can it?"
2005-09-25T15:19:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,right to /etc/inittab - vga= can be set per kernel in /boot/grub/menu.lst I think
2005-09-25T15:19:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,on the kernel line
2005-09-25T15:20:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,I compared the list of modules in /lib/modules for the two kernels.  I found that the one that works has initrd/vesafb.ko and mine doesn't...
2005-09-25T15:20:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"then I know not, I fear"
2005-09-25T15:20:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,aha!
2005-09-25T15:20:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"I'm guessing that's the problem.  but how can I get mine to build that?  Mine has 'kernel/drivers/video/vesafb.ko', as does the working one, but the working one also has vesafb.ko in '.../initrd/'"
2005-09-25T15:21:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I don't know - you need someone versed in the ways of kernel building
2005-09-25T15:22:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,hmmm.  where might I find such a creature?
2005-09-25T15:22:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,erm... dare I suggest #debian ?
2005-09-25T15:23:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,of course any mention of Ubuntu is deprecated if you try that ;-)
2005-09-25T15:23:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,I heard that way be dragons.
2005-09-25T15:23:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"well, there be some clever dragons there"
2005-09-25T15:23:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,I'll be sure to take some gold coins with me and an offering.
2005-09-25T15:24:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I suggest sacrificing a goat at the full moon before proceeding
2005-09-25T15:25:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,never tried it - why would you want to do that?
2005-09-25T15:25:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,curiosity
2005-09-25T15:26:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I assume apt/dpkg is clever enough to warn you if you are about to commit sepuku
2005-09-26T16:06:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,what does the colon do in front of the 'exit 0' in that script?
2005-09-26T16:07:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I don't know :)
2005-09-26T16:08:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,it does nothing apparently
2005-09-26T16:09:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,how did you establish that? (curious)
2005-09-26T16:09:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,'man bash' (evil grin)
2005-09-26T16:09:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,aha! hehehe
2005-09-26T16:14:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,is '' a glottal stop?
2005-09-26T16:15:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,I don't know.  I copy/pasted from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ubuntu
2005-09-26T16:16:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,ah OK :)
2005-09-26T16:23:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,heh - the wiki page for ubuntu pronunciation starts to read like a slashdot comments page ;) Some people have no idea...
2005-09-26T16:24:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I meant wikipedia of course
2005-09-26T16:25:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,'The wikipedia entry for 'python' should point at the programming language <--- how brain-dead can people be?
2005-09-26T16:38:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,is that the same team that typed the works of Shakespeare ?
2005-09-26T16:38:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,they're not THAT old!
2005-09-26T05:09:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"it's quite possible to have been running an FTP server for years, but to be a linux noob.  windows has ftp servers too you know..."
2005-09-26T05:10:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I did say 'probably' :)
2005-09-26T05:10:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,point taken though ;)
2005-10-02T12:05:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,yup
2005-10-05T09:29:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,maybe it's a breezy thang?
2005-10-05T09:29:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,Oh I see - you found it in breezy?
2005-10-05T09:31:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,woah!
2005-10-05T09:31:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,(I'm kindof cheating - that count includes all the KDE dependancies)
2005-10-05T09:32:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I just thought of that possibility ;)
2005-10-05T13:03:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"on the web or locally, do you mean?"
2005-10-05T13:04:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,either.  I need to find libgtk2.0-0 version 2.8.4-0ubuntu1
2005-10-05T13:04:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"(with source too, if possible)"
2005-10-05T13:04:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,looked in /var/cache/apt/archives ? (I mean if you already have it)
2005-10-05T13:04:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,unfortunately only version 2.8.4-0ubuntu2 is in there
2005-10-05T13:05:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,is there no archive online?
2005-10-05T13:05:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I would assume there is - have you tried packages.ubuntu.com ?
2005-10-05T13:05:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,that's an idea
2005-10-05T13:07:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,it seems that packages.u.c only has the current version for each of the beasts
2005-10-05T13:07:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,:(
2005-10-05T13:07:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,do you have it in your /var/cache/apt/archives?
2005-10-05T13:08:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,hang on
2005-10-05T13:10:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,sorry - no luck
2005-10-12T05:18:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,the originators might be interested in your patch :)
2005-10-12T05:57:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"yes, but ssh -X works fine"
2005-10-19T08:30:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,it's always possiblr you actually *needed* the dependencies ;P
2005-10-19T08:30:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,I don't need them - I've compiled much more recent versions of them from the CVS repository
2005-10-19T08:30:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,aha I see :)
2005-10-19T08:31:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,did you install them with checkinstall? I guess apt doesn't know about them?
2005-10-19T08:32:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"the problem is that GNU Emacs is constantly in development, but never makes a release.  the ubuntu version is very out of date, but it's the newest release.  the only solution is to use the CVS stuff"
2005-10-19T08:32:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,I used dpkg -i --ignore-depends
2005-10-19T08:32:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I'm assuming apt/dpkg doesn't know about the stuff you compiled
2005-10-19T08:32:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"it doesn't, no..."
2005-10-19T08:33:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,that's why I mentioned checkinstall
2005-10-19T08:33:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"I'll take a look, thanks"
2005-10-19T09:05:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,'checkinstall' was exactly what I needed.  thank you for your help!
2005-10-19T16:52:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,on the dev list they say the migration will be after dapper IIRC
2005-10-19T16:53:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"launchpad for universe , currently bugzilla for main"
2005-10-19T08:12:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,heh - like the peanut packet that says 'Warning: this food may contain peanuts!' :D
2005-10-19T08:16:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"xcdroast is old, but works well"
2005-11-04T16:43:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"you entered a bug about apt-cache failing, network issues etc, right ?"
2005-11-04T16:43:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,I raised hundreds of bugs :)
2005-11-04T16:44:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,what about it?
2005-11-04T16:44:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"I think I found a partial clue/ solution - if you disable daily checking in synaptic, it seems the apt-cache thing stops breaking"
2005-11-04T16:45:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I confirmed your bug... hmm let me get the number
2005-11-04T16:45:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"the problem seems to be that if your network connection is down or the repo is unavailable, apt-get will delete its cache of the repo contents instead of leaving it alone."
2005-11-04T16:45:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,right
2005-11-04T16:47:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"so by disabling the daily update in synaptic, users not always connected can work around the bug: but there should be some kind of check"
2005-11-04T17:08:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I assume that's the synaptic setting that says 'update daily' or something
2005-11-04T17:08:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"I don't know - I never run synaptic, and the update manager thingy is a separate program isn't it?"
2005-11-04T17:09:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"dunno - but as I said earlier, that setting seems to disable the check/update here"
2005-11-04T17:11:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,it appears to run with cron daily here
2005-11-04T17:11:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I noticed the bug surfaced after cron daily (the deletion thing)
2005-11-04T17:11:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,the problem with cron is that I might not be booted into dapper at the time the crontab is scheduled to run.  then I'd miss the update
2005-11-04T17:12:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"I think the 'cron daily' jobs are really run by anacron, not cron"
2005-11-04T17:12:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,right I see - but evidently anacron runs it as soon as you boot anyway
2005-11-04T17:12:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"ah, you just said the same thing :)"
2005-11-04T17:13:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"I believe anacron runs the daily jobs at 7:30 each morning, or just after the first time you switch runlevels in a day, which ever comes first"
2005-11-04T17:13:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"yes, at about 7:35 here"
2005-11-04T06:20:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,but linux is a noun applied to the kernel
2005-11-07T14:11:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,is there any good reason to use ubuntu's 2.6.12 kernel rather than a vanilla 2.6.14 kernel?
2005-11-07T14:12:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"no idea , sorry - i would assume the ubuntu version is pretty heavily patched ?"
2005-11-18T07:54:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,I think that's the point - with 'knockd' they don't...
2005-11-21T09:41:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,the octal permissions are based on the binary ones
2006-01-21T16:30:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,really? no checkinstall in dapper? or a bug?
2006-01-21T16:30:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,a bug I think
2006-01-21T16:31:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,hope it gets fixed then - useful utility
2006-05-27T05:18:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,interesting - ubotu couldn't find it
2006-05-27T05:19:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,dpkg -S worked here ...
2006-05-27T05:19:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,I used apt-file search
2006-05-27T05:19:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,fair enough
2006-06-01T16:09:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"I've only seen sudo cause problems with KDE apps, personally"
2006-06-01T16:10:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,does it still?  I think that was fixed some time ago
2006-06-01T16:10:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,you may be right - this was last year IIRC
2006-06-01T16:10:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,k3b was one offender I remember
2006-06-01T16:10:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,k3b used to cause problems
2006-06-01T16:11:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,right
2006-06-01T16:35:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,no
2006-06-01T16:35:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,did you seen ubotu's factoid:
2006-06-01T16:35:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"yes, it has a typo"
2006-06-01T16:35:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,now should be 'no'
2006-06-01T16:37:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I think thats right now
2006-06-01T16:38:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"can you get him to miss out the 'alternate is', like it did before?"
2006-06-01T16:38:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I'll have another go
2006-06-01T16:45:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,also low memory machines
2006-06-01T16:45:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,< 192 MB
2006-06-01T16:46:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,I was just quoting from https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2006-May/000140.html
2006-06-01T16:46:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,fair enough ;) But the alternate CD should work better on low-memory machines for standard installs too :)
2006-06-01T16:47:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I seem to recall seeing a discussion on ubuntu-devel list about problems with the desktop CD on low memory systems
2006-06-01T05:13:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,the right-click to burn is a nautilus thing
2006-06-01T05:14:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"yes, that's how I burned the breezy cd I think"
2006-06-09T05:24:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,stop getting the bot to send me free help.  I'm new!
2006-06-09T05:53:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"*cough* I renmoved it, and you didn't see the /msg es"
2006-06-09T05:53:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,and you've been around long enough to know I don't play ganes like that
2006-06-09T05:53:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,so why did you do it?
2006-06-09T05:54:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,you are not aware of the history of hat particular case
2006-06-11T12:44:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,good question
2006-06-11T14:19:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I prefer an elk to a moose ;)
2006-06-11T14:19:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,I heard that about you.
2006-06-11T14:20:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,hahah
2006-06-11T14:20:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,your point
2006-06-11T14:20:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,nothing.  each to his own.
2006-06-11T14:20:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,ah - I meant you get a point for that reply :)
2006-06-11T14:21:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"I'll share it with the moose.  now, any idea how I can get him moving again?"
2006-06-11T14:22:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,hmm - won't a logout keep your apps by default? ( session manager or whatever)
2006-06-11T14:23:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,i've got some stuff running that won't be finished for a few more hours.  i don't want to start it again.
2006-06-11T14:25:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,do you have a USB mouse hanging around? Plugging that in might work...
2006-07-27T12:23:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,java ?
2007-02-13T14:07:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,links2 can IIRC
2007-02-13T14:08:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,w3m
2007-02-13T14:10:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,edgy has had ... issues. Hopefully Feisty will be better
2007-02-13T14:13:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,I'm not upgrading to edgy from dapper - I already did that a long time ago.  These are just updates since edgy was released I think
2007-02-13T14:13:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,right - I have edgy on a partition here but mostly I still run dapper
2005-06-01T15:49:00.000Z,dooglus,,how do I list the files in a package?
2005-06-01T15:50:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,try dpkg -L <packagename>
2005-06-01T15:51:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,assuming it's installed
2005-06-01T15:51:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,then I think you would need apt-file
2005-06-01T15:54:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,heh - thoreauputic
2005-06-01T15:55:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I guess your client is highlighting the line
2005-06-01T15:57:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,change your irssi theme so you can read things ;)
2005-06-01T15:58:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I'm stuck with it now since that is how I'm known
2005-06-01T16:02:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"seriously, change your irssi theme ;)"
2005-06-01T16:03:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,you might need to read someone's long or short <yellow-dude>
2005-06-01T16:03:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,hrm - lots of docs on irssi.org
2005-06-02T07:09:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"some say gnomebaker, others like graveman"
2005-06-02T07:58:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,topyli (I think) suggested ` sudo chmod -x /usr/bin/esd`
2005-06-02T07:58:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I've done it and it seems to be working well here :)
2005-06-02T07:59:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"(I can see your name now that I've changed the background to black and the foreground to white) I think I still need esd for some programs (like totem?) - but according to that RestrictedFormats wiki page, you can ask esd to back off when it's not active"
2005-06-02T08:00:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,hmm - I use totem-xine
2005-06-02T08:00:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,works fine that way
2005-06-02T08:00:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,also I used the suggestions for fixing sound on http://ubuntuguide.org
2005-06-02T08:03:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,thanks.  i hadn't heard of that site before.  looks good!
2005-06-02T08:03:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"yes, it's a one - stop shop, pretty much :)"
2005-06-02T08:04:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"I don't agree with all of it , but it seems pretty sound in general"
2005-06-02T08:27:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,how did you install the 686 kernel?  I don't see a package in synaptic for it
2005-06-02T08:28:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,it's there: apt-cache search linux-image
2005-06-02T08:28:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"heh.  'linux-image', not 'kernel-2.6.something-686'?  odd that the kernel doesn't have 'kernel' in its package name, wouldn't you say?"
2005-06-02T08:29:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"well, linux is the kernel - the rest is the OS ( talk to Richard Stallman *grin*)"
2005-06-02T08:30:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"I know, and that's fair enough."
2005-06-02T08:31:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,GNU/BSD/Ubuntu/Debian Linux *smile*
2005-06-02T08:41:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,does fuser /dev/snd/*   show the devices in use?
2005-06-02T08:42:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,do you mean 'fuser -c'?
2005-06-02T08:43:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,?
2005-06-02T08:43:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,the command you told me doesn't print any output.
2005-06-02T08:43:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,but if I use the '-c' flag I see a lot of output
2005-06-02T08:44:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"oh, I see...  -c means to show all processes using all files on the same device as those devices..."
2005-06-02T08:45:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"if I play some music, then your fuser command shows that the mplayer is using /dev/snd/pcmC0D0p and /dev/snd/timer"
2005-06-02T08:45:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"and if I stop the music player, fuser shows that nothing is using the devices"
2005-06-02T08:45:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,you can play sound then?
2005-06-02T08:45:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"I can play sounds, but I can't hear them..."
2005-06-02T08:45:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"that's logical, is it not?"
2005-06-02T08:46:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,it's as if my ears stopped working.  ubuntu tells me they're playing.
2005-06-02T08:47:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,hmm... I find killing everything sound related and restarting alsa sometimes resurrects sound
2005-06-02T08:48:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,without alsa you won'r hear a thing
2005-06-02T08:48:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,maybe I need to run alsa then...  what's the command?
2005-06-02T08:49:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,all the other bits like OSS need alsa as well in 2.6.* kernels
2005-06-02T08:50:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"I see 'shutting down ALSA - ok; setting up ALSA - ok' - but still 'ps -ef | grep -i alsa' shows nothing, and still my ears tell me that nothing's playing"
2005-06-02T08:51:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,alsa won't show up like that on your ps command
2005-06-02T08:51:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I'm playing music here and alsa doesn't figure in that output
2005-06-02T08:52:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,run alsamixer and use m
2005-06-02T08:52:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,do what bob2 and I suggested
2005-06-02T08:53:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,hahah
2005-06-02T08:54:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,you have a new weapon in your arsenal :)
2005-06-02T08:54:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"I never saw 'alsamixer' before, in all my Mandrake/Mandriva/CentOS days"
2005-06-02T08:54:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,it's well hidden ;)
2005-06-02T08:55:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"like a lot of other utilities, you only find them by living in the cli for a while"
2005-06-02T08:56:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"it's funny you mentioned 'Your Arsenal'.  It's the name of a Morrissey CD.  The track I was using to test the sound, in fact the only .mp3 I have on this computer was a Morrissey track."
2005-06-02T08:57:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"I'm psychic, evidently ;-)"
2005-06-06T15:21:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"people's mileage seems to vary a lot with media players, I've noticed"
2005-06-07T07:52:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,why?
2005-06-07T07:53:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"versioning problems, broken updates etc"
2005-06-07T07:53:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,much grief for many when they upgraded to Hoary
2005-06-07T07:55:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"I never tried it, was interested to hear why you don't recommend it.  thanks."
2005-06-07T07:55:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"what *would* you recommend as a temporary source to get, say, win32 codecs?"
2005-06-07T07:56:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I used marillat testing - but I commented it out right away after I got the codecs
2005-06-07T08:00:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I think they should live in /usr/lib/win32 as Fator_Dee says
2005-06-07T08:01:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"oh, ok"
2005-06-07T08:04:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,that worked - I made a new directory /usr/lib/win32 and moved them all in there
2005-06-07T08:04:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,aha ! :D
2005-06-07T08:05:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"amongst other things, ..."
2005-06-07T08:08:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,funny that SiS7012 is on irq 11 _ I think mine is on 18
2005-06-07T08:08:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"that's the sound card, right?"
2005-06-07T08:09:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,yes
2005-06-07T08:09:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,do 'cat /proc/interrupts' to see the IRQs
2005-06-07T08:10:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,18:    3690083   IO-APIC-level  SiS SI7012
2005-06-08T07:10:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,your 'wget http://nick-zap.home.comcast.net/stuff/unix.pdf| xpdf' command has a couple of problems
2005-06-08T07:10:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,OK - I just thought it would work: i guess the pipe doesn't
2005-06-08T07:11:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,thanks for the correction
2005-06-08T07:11:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,you can 'wget -O- http:/...' if you want to write to stdout
2005-06-08T07:11:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,but I don't know if xpdf can read a document from a pipe anyway
2005-06-08T08:01:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"right click, properties, open with"
2005-06-08T08:02:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"I can do that, but it doesn't seem to offer me any option to 'always use this app by default in future'"
2005-06-08T08:03:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"properties, open with , add, check the one you want"
2005-06-08T08:04:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"I can see 'open with', but not 'add'"
2005-06-08T08:04:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,'properties' at the bottom - choose the 'open with' tab
2005-06-08T08:05:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I think you are in the wrong dialog
2005-06-08T08:05:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"after right click, go to the bottom entry (properties)"
2005-06-08T08:06:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,ok.  i see.  that seems to have hung nautilus though
2005-06-08T08:07:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,hmm - odd
2005-06-08T08:07:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,half an hour ago it told me that nautilus had crashed and asked if I wanted to inform the developers.  but then it got better again.
2005-06-08T08:08:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"I use rox filer here, mostly (I don't like nautilus much and I'm currently using fluxbox, not gnome)"
2005-06-08T08:09:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"I've never liked gnome much.  First impressions with ubuntu were that finally it was stable, but it seems not to be the case really."
2005-06-08T08:10:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,it's OK - I'm happier with fluxbox or xfce4 personally
2005-06-08T10:38:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,sudo apt-get install apt-howto
2005-06-08T10:38:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,but it's fairly detailed
2005-06-08T10:38:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,I like that.  using 'apt' to learn about apt...  :)
2005-06-08T10:38:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,I like details.  It's vagueness I don't like.  :)
2005-06-08T10:56:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,heh - 'It's a Family channel' ;)
2005-06-08T10:59:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,it tends to choke
2005-06-08T10:59:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"I've had better luck with amarok (KDE app, of course, though)"
2005-06-08T11:00:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,hmm - ideology or experience?
2005-06-08T11:00:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,amarok was pretty good - it coped with all my mp3 files
2005-06-08T11:01:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"neither.  I've nothing against KDE, but I just think it makes sense not to mix GTK and KDE apps, for the sake of memory conservation"
2005-06-08T11:01:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I think amarok is the best I've tried so far - but I often just start up xmms or beep-media-player from a directory or use streamtuner
2005-06-08T11:08:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,mono
2005-06-08T11:09:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,verb?
2005-06-08T11:10:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,um - I meant 'mono not .NET' but I guess you knew that
2005-06-08T11:10:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"ok, i see."
2005-06-08T11:14:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,otherwise the answer as always is '42' ;-)
2005-06-08T11:24:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,hmm... the java trap in action then :/
2005-06-08T11:25:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"yes, but...  it's SO pretty...  and SO functional!"
2005-06-08T11:47:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,heh - install some xmms skins right away!
2005-06-08T11:47:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,or winamp skins if that's your thing...
2005-06-08T11:47:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,xmms skins work with beep-media-player?
2005-06-08T11:47:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,yup
2005-06-08T11:58:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,shift-drag
2005-06-08T11:58:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,should snap to the edge in gnome
2005-06-08T12:39:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"yeah, I wish I could find that info too"
2005-06-08T12:40:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"I guess it's user, system, nice, idle, then - um - 'wait'?  and as for 'hi' and 'si' I have no idea"
2005-06-08T12:40:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"yes, the first few seem pretty clear at least"
2005-06-08T12:41:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,my 'wa' shows zero here
2005-06-08T12:42:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"I think mine is usually zero, but I'm running an 'updatedb' with my huge external drive mounted."
2005-06-08T12:42:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,hmm... w_   access ? Guessing...
2005-06-08T14:14:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,is this warty or hoary? Hoary should give you your country code
2005-06-08T14:15:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"this is hoary.  I told it my country when I installed, but it set my up using the .com address..."
2005-06-08T14:16:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,how should hoary give me my country code?  I'm not sure I follow you.
2005-06-08T14:16:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"crimsun is right -  CC.archive.ubuntu.com, where CC is the country code"
2005-06-08T14:16:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,mine is au so au is prepended
2005-06-08T14:17:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,does that make sense?
2005-06-08T14:18:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"sorry, I was away, hunting the slivovice"
2005-06-08T14:18:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,I understand.  but should hoary have put the 'cz.' in for me?  or am I expected to know that I have to put it there?
2005-06-08T14:19:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,my understanding is thet it should be put in for you
2005-06-08T14:19:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,mine was put in automatically
2005-06-08T14:19:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,that's strange then.
2005-06-08T14:20:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"hmm - maybe there is no cz sever address, I don't know"
2005-06-08T14:32:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,what do you see if you run 'grep hoary-security /etc/apt/sources.list' please?
2005-06-08T14:33:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,because: 'unknown host au.security.ubuntu.com'
2005-06-08T14:33:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I get 4 lines
2005-06-08T14:34:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,what are the hostnames?
2005-06-08T14:34:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I can paste in #flood if you care to look
2005-06-08T14:55:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"as bob2 said, it ends up at  ge-0-0.access8.lon2.mnet.net.uk via the US - funny !"
2005-06-08T14:55:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,so the au sever is in the UK - what a joke
2005-06-08T14:55:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,so I'm going to use ubuntu.cz instead...  that doesn't go via several oceans...
2005-06-08T14:55:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,I guess you should pick a source from http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/Archive
2005-06-08T14:56:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,what *are* they thinking?
2005-06-08T14:56:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,indeed
2005-06-10T09:07:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,there's a 'sensor' command I seem to recall
2005-06-10T09:07:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,hmm..maybe not
2005-06-10T10:24:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,consider doing 'set -o noclobber' in your .bashrc - then you can't accidentally lose stuff by doing '>' instead of '>>'
2005-06-10T10:24:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,it's Ok - I didn't clobber anything as it was a test: but good point
2005-06-10T10:25:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,next time you might not be so lucky :)
2005-06-10T10:25:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,indeed
2005-06-10T10:25:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,thanks :)
2005-06-11T11:51:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,dist-upgrade
2005-06-13T08:50:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,you X link is quite amusing :)
2005-06-13T08:51:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,I'm reading it too.  He's quite angry :)
2005-06-13T08:51:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"it's an old piece, but still pretty much true today."
2005-06-13T10:01:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,you might want to read that URL
2005-06-13T10:02:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,ubotu's
2005-06-13T10:09:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"thanks, but I think that's the link which got my into this mess in the first place..."
2005-06-13T10:10:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"oh, sorry - it worked for me fine :/"
2005-06-13T07:57:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,for a rough estimste cd to /var/cache /apt/archives and try ' for each in *.deb ; do du -h $each ; done '
2005-06-13T07:58:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,assuming you haven't cleared your apt cache of course
2005-06-13T08:04:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"I was being a bit silly... synaptic allows me to just list installed packages, and to sort by size...  duh!"
2005-06-13T08:04:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,ah - much easier ! :)
2005-06-13T08:05:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I just did mine and discovered for some reason a lot of debs have been cleared from my cache without my asking: this isn't very Debianish - I expected all to be there! Odd...
2005-06-13T08:06:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,I'm sure I saw somewhere that the cache is cleared of anything over 7 days old?
2005-06-13T08:06:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I'll google... but on debian I seem to recall this didn't happen
2005-06-13T08:08:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"the apt-get clean command is supposed to clear the cache explicitly, I thought"
2005-06-13T10:08:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,the main trouble isn't rpm so much as the weird variety of different rms
2005-06-13T10:08:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,there's only one rms!
2005-06-13T10:09:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,like SUSE and Mandriva are  not compatible with Redhat
2005-06-13T10:09:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,sorry typo ;)
2005-06-13T10:11:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"yes, but a Mandriva RPM won't necessarily work on SUSE, for example"
2005-06-14T12:58:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"it would speed up performance if he compiled his own packages, surely?"
2005-06-14T12:59:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"well, i encourage the use of Ubuntu packages, because I don't want to hold people's hands whem they break their package management"
2005-06-14T13:01:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"but i guess that's presumptuous of me, so yaeh"
2005-06-14T13:13:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,there is ntpdate (which is the thing you saw) and an ntpdate daemon (which isn't installed by default)
2005-06-14T13:14:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"aah, i see."
2005-06-20T11:50:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,no worries:)
2005-09-25T14:37:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,you might want to try installing deborphan
2005-09-25T14:37:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,might I?
2005-09-25T14:38:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"well, deborphan will find orphaned packages :)"
2005-09-25T14:38:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"ooh, that sounds good."
2005-09-25T14:46:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,thanks for suggesting deborphan.  that helped a lot
2005-09-25T14:47:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,you're welcome :)
2005-09-25T15:09:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,you built a deb for it?
2005-09-25T15:09:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,I did.  I ran 'make-kpkg --initrd --revision=cim.2.6.12.1 kernel_image' like the readme told me to.
2005-09-25T15:10:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,is it in /var/cache/apt/archives ?
2005-09-25T15:10:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,aha
2005-09-25T15:10:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,I clean the cache regularly
2005-09-25T15:10:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,OK
2005-09-25T15:11:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,but you just discovered that the system believed you when you named it kernel-image *grin*
2005-09-25T15:12:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,you should suggest this as a way to reduce confusion among new users ;-)
2005-09-25T15:13:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,my 6 'virtual consoles' are all black on black too.
2005-09-25T15:13:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,ah - not so good
2005-09-25T15:13:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,setterm might help...
2005-09-25T15:14:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"well, your new kernel is entertaining at least :)"
2005-09-25T15:15:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,man setterm *evil grin*
2005-09-25T15:17:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,setterm doesn't seem to have any effect on the VCs
2005-09-25T15:17:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,oh. Is your /etc/inittab normal looking?
2005-09-25T15:18:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"I have 2 kernels installed - the regular breezy one, and the one I built myself.  One has working VCs, the other doesn't.  So it can't be anything about /etc/inittab, right?  Or vga= options.  Can it?"
2005-09-25T15:19:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,right to /etc/inittab - vga= can be set per kernel in /boot/grub/menu.lst I think
2005-09-25T15:19:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,on the kernel line
2005-09-25T15:20:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,I compared the list of modules in /lib/modules for the two kernels.  I found that the one that works has initrd/vesafb.ko and mine doesn't...
2005-09-25T15:20:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"then I know not, I fear"
2005-09-25T15:20:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,aha!
2005-09-25T15:20:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"I'm guessing that's the problem.  but how can I get mine to build that?  Mine has 'kernel/drivers/video/vesafb.ko', as does the working one, but the working one also has vesafb.ko in '.../initrd/'"
2005-09-25T15:21:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I don't know - you need someone versed in the ways of kernel building
2005-09-25T15:22:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,hmmm.  where might I find such a creature?
2005-09-25T15:22:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,erm... dare I suggest #debian ?
2005-09-25T15:23:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,of course any mention of Ubuntu is deprecated if you try that ;-)
2005-09-25T15:23:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,I heard that way be dragons.
2005-09-25T15:23:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"well, there be some clever dragons there"
2005-09-25T15:23:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,I'll be sure to take some gold coins with me and an offering.
2005-09-25T15:24:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I suggest sacrificing a goat at the full moon before proceeding
2005-09-25T15:25:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,never tried it - why would you want to do that?
2005-09-25T15:25:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,curiosity
2005-09-25T15:26:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I assume apt/dpkg is clever enough to warn you if you are about to commit sepuku
2005-09-26T16:06:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,what does the colon do in front of the 'exit 0' in that script?
2005-09-26T16:07:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I don't know :)
2005-09-26T16:08:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,it does nothing apparently
2005-09-26T16:09:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,how did you establish that? (curious)
2005-09-26T16:09:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,'man bash' (evil grin)
2005-09-26T16:09:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,aha! hehehe
2005-09-26T16:14:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,is '' a glottal stop?
2005-09-26T16:15:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,I don't know.  I copy/pasted from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ubuntu
2005-09-26T16:16:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,ah OK :)
2005-09-26T16:23:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,heh - the wiki page for ubuntu pronunciation starts to read like a slashdot comments page ;) Some people have no idea...
2005-09-26T16:24:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I meant wikipedia of course
2005-09-26T16:25:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,'The wikipedia entry for 'python' should point at the programming language <--- how brain-dead can people be?
2005-09-26T16:38:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,is that the same team that typed the works of Shakespeare ?
2005-09-26T16:38:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,they're not THAT old!

2005-09-26T05:10:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I did say 'probably' :)
2005-09-26T05:10:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,point taken though ;)
2005-10-02T12:05:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,yup
2005-10-05T09:29:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,maybe it's a breezy thang?
2005-10-05T09:29:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,Oh I see - you found it in breezy?
2005-10-05T09:31:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,woah!
2005-10-05T09:31:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,(I'm kindof cheating - that count includes all the KDE dependancies)
2005-10-05T09:32:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I just thought of that possibility ;)
2005-10-05T13:03:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"on the web or locally, do you mean?"
2005-10-05T13:04:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,either.  I need to find libgtk2.0-0 version 2.8.4-0ubuntu1
2005-10-05T13:04:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"(with source too, if possible)"
2005-10-05T13:04:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,looked in /var/cache/apt/archives ? (I mean if you already have it)
2005-10-05T13:04:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,unfortunately only version 2.8.4-0ubuntu2 is in there
2005-10-05T13:05:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,is there no archive online?
2005-10-05T13:05:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I would assume there is - have you tried packages.ubuntu.com ?
2005-10-05T13:05:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,that's an idea
2005-10-05T13:07:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,it seems that packages.u.c only has the current version for each of the beasts
2005-10-05T13:07:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,:(
2005-10-05T13:07:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,do you have it in your /var/cache/apt/archives?
2005-10-05T13:08:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,hang on
2005-10-05T13:10:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,sorry - no luck
2005-10-12T05:18:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,the originators might be interested in your patch :)
2005-10-12T05:57:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"yes, but ssh -X works fine"
2005-10-19T08:30:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,it's always possiblr you actually *needed* the dependencies ;P
2005-10-19T08:30:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,I don't need them - I've compiled much more recent versions of them from the CVS repository
2005-10-19T08:30:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,aha I see :)
2005-10-19T08:31:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,did you install them with checkinstall? I guess apt doesn't know about them?
2005-10-19T08:32:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"the problem is that GNU Emacs is constantly in development, but never makes a release.  the ubuntu version is very out of date, but it's the newest release.  the only solution is to use the CVS stuff"
2005-10-19T08:32:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,I used dpkg -i --ignore-depends
2005-10-19T08:32:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I'm assuming apt/dpkg doesn't know about the stuff you compiled
2005-10-19T08:32:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"it doesn't, no..."
2005-10-19T08:33:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,that's why I mentioned checkinstall
2005-10-19T08:33:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"I'll take a look, thanks"
2005-10-19T09:05:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,'checkinstall' was exactly what I needed.  thank you for your help!

2005-11-04T16:44:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,what about it?
2005-11-04T16:44:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"I think I found a partial clue/ solution - if you disable daily checking in synaptic, it seems the apt-cache thing stops breaking"
2005-11-04T16:45:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I confirmed your bug... hmm let me get the number
2005-11-04T16:45:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"the problem seems to be that if your network connection is down or the repo is unavailable, apt-get will delete its cache of the repo contents instead of leaving it alone."
2005-11-04T16:45:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,right
2005-11-04T16:47:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"so by disabling the daily update in synaptic, users not always connected can work around the bug: but there should be some kind of check"
2005-11-04T17:08:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I assume that's the synaptic setting that says 'update daily' or something
2005-11-04T17:08:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"I don't know - I never run synaptic, and the update manager thingy is a separate program isn't it?"
2005-11-04T17:09:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"dunno - but as I said earlier, that setting seems to disable the check/update here"
2005-11-04T17:11:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,it appears to run with cron daily here
2005-11-04T17:11:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I noticed the bug surfaced after cron daily (the deletion thing)
2005-11-04T17:11:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,the problem with cron is that I might not be booted into dapper at the time the crontab is scheduled to run.  then I'd miss the update
2005-11-04T17:12:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"I think the 'cron daily' jobs are really run by anacron, not cron"
2005-11-04T17:12:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,right I see - but evidently anacron runs it as soon as you boot anyway
2005-11-04T17:12:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"ah, you just said the same thing :)"
2005-11-04T17:13:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"I believe anacron runs the daily jobs at 7:30 each morning, or just after the first time you switch runlevels in a day, which ever comes first"
2005-11-04T17:13:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"yes, at about 7:35 here"
2005-11-04T06:20:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,but linux is a noun applied to the kernel
2005-11-07T14:11:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,is there any good reason to use ubuntu's 2.6.12 kernel rather than a vanilla 2.6.14 kernel?
2005-11-07T14:12:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"no idea , sorry - i would assume the ubuntu version is pretty heavily patched ?"
2005-11-18T07:54:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,I think that's the point - with 'knockd' they don't...
2005-11-21T09:41:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,the octal permissions are based on the binary ones
2006-01-21T16:30:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,really? no checkinstall in dapper? or a bug?
2006-01-21T16:30:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,a bug I think
2006-01-21T16:31:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,hope it gets fixed then - useful utility
2006-05-27T05:18:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,interesting - ubotu couldn't find it
2006-05-27T05:19:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,dpkg -S worked here ...
2006-05-27T05:19:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,I used apt-file search
2006-05-27T05:19:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,fair enough
2006-06-01T16:09:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"I've only seen sudo cause problems with KDE apps, personally"
2006-06-01T16:10:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,does it still?  I think that was fixed some time ago
2006-06-01T16:10:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,you may be right - this was last year IIRC
2006-06-01T16:10:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,k3b was one offender I remember
2006-06-01T16:10:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,k3b used to cause problems
2006-06-01T16:11:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,right
2006-06-01T16:35:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,no
2006-06-01T16:35:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,did you seen ubotu's factoid:
2006-06-01T16:35:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"yes, it has a typo"
2006-06-01T16:35:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,now should be 'no'
2006-06-01T16:37:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I think thats right now
2006-06-01T16:38:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"can you get him to miss out the 'alternate is', like it did before?"
2006-06-01T16:38:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I'll have another go
2006-06-01T16:45:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,also low memory machines
2006-06-01T16:45:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,< 192 MB
2006-06-01T16:46:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,I was just quoting from https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2006-May/000140.html
2006-06-01T16:46:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,fair enough ;) But the alternate CD should work better on low-memory machines for standard installs too :)
2006-06-01T16:47:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I seem to recall seeing a discussion on ubuntu-devel list about problems with the desktop CD on low memory systems
2006-06-01T05:13:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,the right-click to burn is a nautilus thing
2006-06-01T05:14:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"yes, that's how I burned the breezy cd I think"
2006-06-09T05:24:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,stop getting the bot to send me free help.  I'm new!
2006-06-09T05:53:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,"*cough* I renmoved it, and you didn't see the /msg es"
2006-06-09T05:53:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,and you've been around long enough to know I don't play ganes like that
2006-06-09T05:53:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,so why did you do it?
2006-06-09T05:54:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,you are not aware of the history of hat particular case
2006-06-11T12:44:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,good question
2006-06-11T14:19:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,I prefer an elk to a moose ;)
2006-06-11T14:19:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,I heard that about you.
2006-06-11T14:20:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,hahah
2006-06-11T14:20:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,your point
2006-06-11T14:20:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,nothing.  each to his own.
2006-06-11T14:20:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,ah - I meant you get a point for that reply :)
2006-06-11T14:21:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,"I'll share it with the moose.  now, any idea how I can get him moving again?"
2006-06-11T14:22:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,hmm - won't a logout keep your apps by default? ( session manager or whatever)
2006-06-11T14:23:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,i've got some stuff running that won't be finished for a few more hours.  i don't want to start it again.
2006-06-11T14:25:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,do you have a USB mouse hanging around? Plugging that in might work...
2006-07-27T12:23:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,java ?
2007-02-13T14:07:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,links2 can IIRC
2007-02-13T14:08:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,w3m
2007-02-13T14:10:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,edgy has had ... issues. Hopefully Feisty will be better
2007-02-13T14:13:00.000Z,dooglus,thoreauputic,I'm not upgrading to edgy from dapper - I already did that a long time ago.  These are just updates since edgy was released I think
2007-02-13T14:13:00.000Z,thoreauputic,dooglus,right - I have edgy on a partition here but mostly I still run dapper
