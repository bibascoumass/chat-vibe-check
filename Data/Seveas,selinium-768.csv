2005-06-24T16:19:00.000Z,Seveas,selinium,it doesn't exist on hoary if you upgraded from warty
2005-06-24T16:19:00.000Z,Seveas,selinium,but you can easily add it
2005-06-24T16:20:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas,Cheers
2005-06-24T16:23:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas,where would we be able to see this new version. Or can't we yet?
2005-06-24T16:23:00.000Z,Seveas,selinium,"not yet, it'll be released soon i guess"
2005-06-24T16:25:00.000Z,Seveas,selinium,why?
2005-06-28T10:48:00.000Z,Seveas,selinium,/home/james/.music is not allowed to exist if you want to create a link with that name
2005-06-28T10:50:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas,how would I 'connect' the music file so they appear in the Imcoming folder?
2005-06-28T10:50:00.000Z,Seveas,selinium,what do you mean with connect?
2005-06-28T10:50:00.000Z,Seveas,selinium,making 2 folders appear as one..?
2005-06-28T10:51:00.000Z,Seveas,selinium,not possible
2005-06-28T10:52:00.000Z,Seveas,selinium,move all files in .music to the incoming folder
2005-06-28T10:53:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas,I was hoping not to have to do that.. So I cannot create a hard link or something like that then? I do not wish to have two identicle folders..
2005-06-28T10:53:00.000Z,Seveas,selinium,"no, not possible.."
2005-06-28T10:54:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas,cheers for letting me know! When would you create a hard link then? [curious]  :)
2005-06-28T10:54:00.000Z,Seveas,selinium,to make 2 folders really appear like one and you have a reason not to use a softlink
2005-06-28T10:56:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas,Can i create a soft link then... Sorry to be so stupid! :)
2005-06-28T10:56:00.000Z,Seveas,selinium,ln -s IS the softlink
2005-06-28T10:56:00.000Z,Seveas,selinium,you might have misunderstoof me

2005-07-02T11:52:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas,cheers! it creates that error message when a music cd is put in. It works ok for data.

2005-07-02T11:56:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas,Arrghhh It works.... I have been wasting soooo much time trying to fix something that wasn't broke.. THankyou for showing me the light.
2005-07-02T11:58:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas,this all started when i put a data cd in the drive and tried to view the contents. DO i need to mount the cd before I can? Does ubuntu not mount a data cd automatically?
2005-07-02T11:58:00.000Z,Seveas,selinium,it should automount...
2005-07-02T12:00:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas, Any reason i can check why it isn't?
2005-07-02T12:00:00.000Z,Seveas,selinium,check if D-BUS is running...
2005-07-02T12:04:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas,it appears to be running.
2005-07-02T12:05:00.000Z,Seveas,selinium,maybe you disabled it in system -> prefs -> removable media

2005-07-02T12:13:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas,No i am running hoary 5.04 I believe. I switched a little while ago to the K7 version.

2005-07-02T12:15:00.000Z,Seveas,selinium,plugdev should be there too iirc
2005-07-02T12:15:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas,GOt plugdec as well.   iirc?
2005-07-02T12:18:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas,"Thank for all your help. I will be rebuilding the pc soon anyway, I am sure the problems will disappear after a fresh install. Thanks again. :)"

2005-07-05T05:55:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas,is there a way of opening a application in a particular workspace?
2005-07-05T05:55:00.000Z,Seveas,selinium,afaik that's onging work...

2005-07-16T08:41:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas,is there a particular section? I have been looing for some time... :)
2005-07-16T08:41:00.000Z,Seveas,selinium,there is the searchpage and the titleindex :)
2005-07-16T08:41:00.000Z,Seveas,selinium,what are you looking for in particular?

2005-07-16T09:36:00.000Z,Seveas,selinium,Please do not advise people to use ubuntuguide.  Advise https://wiki.ubuntu.com instead. Item 3 on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NewUsersNetworkGuidelines explains why.
2005-07-16T09:36:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas,"Ok, Will look"
2005-07-16T09:42:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas,I understand the reasoning behind not using ubuntuguide but it linked from https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UserDocumentation and was one of the first resources I found using the wiki! :)

2005-08-08T16:16:00.000Z,Seveas,selinium,uname only tells you which kernel you installed
2005-08-08T16:16:00.000Z,Seveas,selinium,you probably installed linux-686 already ;)

2005-08-29T05:35:00.000Z,Seveas,selinium,it's transcode from breezy
2005-08-29T05:35:00.000Z,Seveas,selinium,"and the server is NOT online 24/7, so apt-get update may fail at times if you have it in your sources.list"
2005-08-29T05:37:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas,Does that meann it will not function. I switched the repo on when you did the wammu/gammu stuff. I switch it stright off
2005-08-29T05:37:00.000Z,Seveas,selinium,"the server does work, I just switch the thing off at night"

2005-09-05T05:01:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas,Would it be better to do a dd if=/mnt/old of=/mnt/new  ?
2005-09-05T05:03:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas,how would you move your system onto a new hd without installing from scratch?
2005-09-05T05:19:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas,"sorry for bugging you, but would yuo even try to do a disc copy like i suggested?"
2005-09-05T05:26:00.000Z,Seveas,selinium,"no i would not even try, i would do a reinstall + some dpkg magic and copying config files"

2005-09-11T08:47:00.000Z,Seveas,selinium,if it has 1 partition on it it's simply hdb
2005-09-11T08:49:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas,"It is an expansion drive, i will be moving /home onto it when I can get it working! It is fine as a single partition, yes?"
2005-09-11T08:52:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas,I have set up fstab to point /dev/hdb /media/windows so I can make a copy of the /home before changing anything. But when I try to mount hdb it says mount: /dev/hdb already mounted or /media/windows busy. But neither is applicable... :/

2006-03-25T12:47:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas,"i have used autopackage the once, I didn't realise it could knacker dpkg, that would explain some of the 'issues' I had! :)"
2006-03-25T12:47:00.000Z,Seveas,selinium,klik is a much saner approach (made by much less insane people too)

2006-05-15T06:11:00.000Z,Seveas,selinium,in the case of skype it's quite hackish...
2006-05-15T06:12:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas,"OOOooh! :)  I have tried out openwengo. it seems to be a good alternative, once you remove all the dlls that come packed with it.."

2005-06-24T16:25:00.000Z,Seveas,selinium,why?

2005-06-28T10:53:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas,I was hoping not to have to do that.. So I cannot create a hard link or something like that then? I do not wish to have two identicle folders..
2005-06-28T10:53:00.000Z,Seveas,selinium,"no, not possible.."
2005-06-28T10:54:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas,cheers for letting me know! When would you create a hard link then? [curious]  :)
2005-06-28T10:54:00.000Z,Seveas,selinium,to make 2 folders really appear like one and you have a reason not to use a softlink
2005-06-28T10:56:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas,Can i create a soft link then... Sorry to be so stupid! :)
2005-06-28T10:56:00.000Z,Seveas,selinium,ln -s IS the softlink

2005-07-02T11:58:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas,this all started when i put a data cd in the drive and tried to view the contents. DO i need to mount the cd before I can? Does ubuntu not mount a data cd automatically?
2005-07-02T11:58:00.000Z,Seveas,selinium,it should automount...
2005-07-02T12:00:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas, Any reason i can check why it isn't?
2005-07-02T12:00:00.000Z,Seveas,selinium,check if D-BUS is running...
2005-07-02T12:04:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas,it appears to be running.

2005-08-29T05:18:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas,DO you know of a way of starting xmms without it creating a tab? I want to use gxmms but it seems silly to have xmms refenced all over the shop
2005-08-29T05:21:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas,yes the icon in the task bar. It is taking up valuable space! :)

2005-08-29T05:32:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas,I just auto upgraded with your repo up. It has installed transcode as well. That isn't likely to cause any trouble is it?
2005-08-29T05:35:00.000Z,Seveas,selinium,it's transcode from breezy
2005-08-29T05:35:00.000Z,Seveas,selinium,"and the server is NOT online 24/7, so apt-get update may fail at times if you have it in your sources.list"
2005-08-29T05:37:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas,Does that meann it will not function. I switched the repo on when you did the wammu/gammu stuff. I switch it stright off
2005-08-29T05:37:00.000Z,Seveas,selinium,"the server does work, I just switch the thing off at night"
2005-08-29T05:38:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas,I don't have your repo in my list all the time. I meant will the transcode work? :)

2005-09-05T05:03:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas,how would you move your system onto a new hd without installing from scratch?
2005-09-05T05:19:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas,"sorry for bugging you, but would yuo even try to do a disc copy like i suggested?"
2005-09-05T05:26:00.000Z,Seveas,selinium,"no i would not even try, i would do a reinstall + some dpkg magic and copying config files"
2005-09-05T05:26:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas,Cheers.

2005-09-11T08:46:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas,I used Gparted to format the drive. but it doesn't seem to want to play ball! My new drive is hdb not hdb1 as I expected?
2005-09-11T08:47:00.000Z,Seveas,selinium,if it has 1 partition on it it's simply hdb
2005-09-11T08:49:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas,"It is an expansion drive, i will be moving /home onto it when I can get it working! It is fine as a single partition, yes?"
2005-09-11T08:52:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas,I have set up fstab to point /dev/hdb /media/windows so I can make a copy of the /home before changing anything. But when I try to mount hdb it says mount: /dev/hdb already mounted or /media/windows busy. But neither is applicable... :/

2005-09-11T09:22:00.000Z,Seveas,selinium,"right, fire up *parted or cfdisk again and repartition"
2005-09-11T09:23:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas,apokryphos: Does it need to be a primary or extended? I 've been using primary

2005-10-30T10:00:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas,"firstly it would not install because it winged about not being able to install phpmyadmin, so I installed phpmyadmin and tried to run it again and it still complaind about the missing phpmyadmin. Then I tried to remove phpmyadmin, and it was broken and unremovable! ompaul also installed phpmyadmin to see if there was a problem with the deb and he suffered the same fate! :)"

2006-05-15T06:11:00.000Z,Seveas,selinium,in the case of skype it's quite hackish...
2006-05-15T06:12:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas,"OOOooh! :)  I have tried out openwengo. it seems to be a good alternative, once you remove all the dlls that come packed with it.."
2006-05-15T14:11:00.000Z,selinium,Seveas,"Hi there, I can't find sun-j2re in your mirrors (Dapper) can I install from Sun? :)"
