2005-04-06T06:14:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,RFCs are the final say in this
2005-04-06T06:14:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,iptables (which Ubuntu uses) can block anything
2005-04-06T06:15:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,iptables IS the firewall
2005-04-06T07:10:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,wtf?

2005-04-06T07:11:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,"on 686, you should install a 686 kernel :)"
2005-04-06T07:11:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,you are ALL wrong
2005-04-06T07:12:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,do you care to elaborate on that?
2005-04-06T07:12:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,"i will, in a sec"
2005-04-06T07:16:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,i'm still curious about why i was wrong
2005-04-06T07:16:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,ty for reminding me
2005-04-06T07:17:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,hold  on

2005-04-06T07:18:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,of course you can
2005-04-06T07:19:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,why?
2005-04-06T07:19:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,because otherwise you do not use the full capacity of your processor
2005-04-06T07:54:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,what does imnho mean
2005-04-07T08:44:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,"you drop it, too."
2005-04-07T08:44:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,drop what?
2005-04-07T08:44:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,this isn't an argument
2005-04-07T08:47:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,stop shouting
2005-04-07T09:13:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,modprobe loop
2005-06-25T13:23:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,ar isn't a package by itself
2005-06-25T13:27:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,ah :0
2005-06-25T13:27:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,i installed build-essential
2005-06-25T13:27:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,that should have done it too
2005-06-25T13:30:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,?
2005-06-25T13:31:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,why arree you opping yourself up
2005-06-25T13:33:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda bs=512 count=1
2005-06-25T13:33:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,that'll wipe the MBR clean
2005-06-25T13:33:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,ummm
2005-06-25T13:34:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,"windows needs something present in the MBR too, that's what fdisk /mbr does..."
2005-06-25T13:34:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,okay
2005-07-11T06:47:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,dist-upgrade
2005-07-11T08:17:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,ubuntuguide.org is crap
2005-07-11T08:19:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,"yeah, and pure BS. reka gave a example... 'configure sound properly' section. it's long, gives NO, ZERO, NIL, VOID, explanation of what the commands do, yet they work....and as for the repossitories, why suggest adding a new repo?"
2005-07-11T15:39:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,what happened to lots of people
2005-07-11T15:40:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,.ICEauth /.Xauth got fubar -> next login hangs
2005-07-11T15:40:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,"er, define hangs"
2005-07-11T15:41:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,a chown user:user then a chmod solved it
2005-07-11T15:41:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,"it's like what happened to eliUbuntu, after entering your password, gnome hangs, you never get even the splash screen"
2005-07-11T15:41:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,sure
2005-07-11T15:41:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,i inadvertently said chmod 666 in a terminal once on debian
2005-07-11T15:42:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,and debian gnome didnt start
2005-07-11T15:43:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,"then i chose to (out of my noobness) reboot and use single, then do these 2 commands i mentioned above"
2005-07-11T15:43:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,"i know rebooting is overkill, but ....."
2005-07-11T15:43:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,"actually, it was 644, not 666"
2005-07-11T15:43:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,how are newbies going to associate not logging in without apparent reason with .ICEauthority..?
2005-07-11T15:45:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,"I inadvertenly did chmod 644 in ~ on Debian before, and I could not log on to whatever DE I was using, so I ended up having to chmod and chown"
2005-07-11T15:50:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,huh.....
2005-07-16T08:35:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,true
2005-07-16T14:53:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,should I make a factoid for that? :)
2005-07-16T14:54:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,the question has been asked many times
2005-07-16T14:55:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,and nalioth and El_Che: define 'backported' and maybe the newbies can understand what it means ;)
2005-07-16T14:56:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,ack
2005-07-16T15:45:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,?
2005-07-16T15:46:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,what did he do?
2005-07-22T09:09:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,this has been mentioned in a factoid
2005-10-08T05:50:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,good :)
2005-10-07T12:41:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,hi
2005-10-07T12:41:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,what's up?

2005-10-07T12:44:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,will Breezy include GNOME 2.12?
2005-10-07T14:09:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,i have a game on cd. but its win32 only :'(
2005-10-07T14:09:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,try if it works with wine ;)
2005-10-07T14:10:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,cant install it now
2005-10-07T14:11:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,but you would never use GUI
2005-10-07T14:11:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,"I use gui all the time, even on a few of my servers :)"
2005-10-07T14:12:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,why?
2005-10-07T14:44:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,not there on here

2005-10-07T15:13:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,"what, that repo? No way, it's just a testing/personal dev. area :)"
2005-10-07T15:14:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,"no, the release stuff"
2005-10-07T15:49:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,ping.

2005-10-08T16:29:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,hoary is half a year old now
2005-10-08T16:29:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,i'm not rushing to breezy yet
2005-10-08T16:29:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,it is not stable.

2005-10-08T16:42:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,given that it's already in the topic we can assume noone reads it...
2005-10-08T16:43:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,Thanks ;)

2005-10-08T05:25:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,i got the imprerssion there was no ubuntu dvd
2005-10-08T05:27:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,that doesnt make sense (on C compiler not in the package set). why isnt it in there?
2005-10-08T05:27:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,normal users don't need it
2005-10-08T05:27:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,ok
2005-10-08T06:42:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,why do you think ap is the worst
2005-10-08T06:42:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,"because it overwrites things without warning, brings back dll hell and is worse than rpm hell"
2005-10-08T06:44:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,hehe.
2005-10-08T06:45:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,are you satisfied now?

2005-10-08T05:49:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,"it's Ubuntu, not Ubuntu linux or Ubuntu GNU/linux"
2005-10-08T05:50:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,I know. ;)
2005-10-12T06:27:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,are meta packages trivial to make? ;)
2005-10-12T06:27:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,extremely
2005-10-12T08:38:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,are you there?

2005-10-16T07:22:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,"if you take out all packages, nothing is left..."
2005-10-16T07:22:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,are you sure ubuntu isnt licensed?

2005-04-06T07:19:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,because otherwise you do not use the full capacity of your processor
2005-04-06T07:54:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,what does imnho mean
2005-04-07T08:44:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,"you drop it, too."
2005-04-07T08:44:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,drop what?
2005-04-07T08:44:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,this isn't an argument
2005-04-07T08:47:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,stop shouting
2005-04-07T09:13:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,modprobe loop
2005-06-25T13:23:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,ar isn't a package by itself
2005-06-25T13:27:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,ah :0
2005-06-25T13:27:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,i installed build-essential
2005-06-25T13:27:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,that should have done it too
2005-06-25T13:30:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,?
2005-06-25T13:31:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,why arree you opping yourself up
2005-06-25T13:33:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda bs=512 count=1
2005-06-25T13:33:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,that'll wipe the MBR clean
2005-06-25T13:33:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,ummm
2005-06-25T13:34:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,"windows needs something present in the MBR too, that's what fdisk /mbr does..."
2005-06-25T13:34:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,okay
2005-07-11T06:47:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,dist-upgrade
2005-07-11T08:17:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,ubuntuguide.org is crap
2005-07-11T08:19:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,"yeah, and pure BS. reka gave a example... 'configure sound properly' section. it's long, gives NO, ZERO, NIL, VOID, explanation of what the commands do, yet they work....and as for the repossitories, why suggest adding a new repo?"
2005-07-11T15:39:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,what happened to lots of people
2005-07-11T15:40:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,.ICEauth /.Xauth got fubar -> next login hangs
2005-07-11T15:40:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,"er, define hangs"
2005-07-11T15:41:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,a chown user:user then a chmod solved it
2005-07-11T15:41:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,"it's like what happened to eliUbuntu, after entering your password, gnome hangs, you never get even the splash screen"
2005-07-11T15:41:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,sure
2005-07-11T15:41:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,i inadvertently said chmod 666 in a terminal once on debian
2005-07-11T15:42:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,and debian gnome didnt start
2005-07-11T15:43:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,"then i chose to (out of my noobness) reboot and use single, then do these 2 commands i mentioned above"
2005-07-11T15:43:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,"i know rebooting is overkill, but ....."
2005-07-11T15:43:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,"actually, it was 644, not 666"
2005-07-11T15:43:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,how are newbies going to associate not logging in without apparent reason with .ICEauthority..?
2005-07-11T15:45:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,"I inadvertenly did chmod 644 in ~ on Debian before, and I could not log on to whatever DE I was using, so I ended up having to chmod and chown"
2005-07-11T15:50:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,huh.....
2005-07-16T08:35:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,true
2005-07-16T14:53:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,should I make a factoid for that? :)
2005-07-16T14:54:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,the question has been asked many times
2005-07-16T14:55:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,and nalioth and El_Che: define 'backported' and maybe the newbies can understand what it means ;)
2005-07-16T14:56:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,ack
2005-07-16T15:45:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,?
2005-07-16T15:46:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,what did he do?
2005-07-22T09:09:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,this has been mentioned in a factoid
2005-10-08T05:50:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,good :)
2005-10-07T12:41:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,hi
2005-10-07T12:41:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,what's up?
2005-10-07T12:43:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,busy rewriting my repo scripts :)
2005-10-07T12:44:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,will Breezy include GNOME 2.12?
2005-10-07T14:09:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,i have a game on cd. but its win32 only :'(
2005-10-07T14:09:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,try if it works with wine ;)
2005-10-07T14:10:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,cant install it now
2005-10-07T14:11:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,but you would never use GUI
2005-10-07T14:11:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,"I use gui all the time, even on a few of my servers :)"
2005-10-07T14:12:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,why?

2005-10-07T14:59:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,what was he saying?
2005-10-07T15:13:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,"what, that repo? No way, it's just a testing/personal dev. area :)"
2005-10-07T15:14:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,"no, the release stuff"
2005-10-07T15:49:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,ping.

2005-10-08T16:29:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,hoary is half a year old now
2005-10-08T16:29:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,i'm not rushing to breezy yet
2005-10-08T16:29:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,it is not stable.

2005-10-08T16:42:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,given that it's already in the topic we can assume noone reads it...
2005-10-08T16:43:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,Thanks ;)

2005-10-08T05:25:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,i got the imprerssion there was no ubuntu dvd
2005-10-08T05:27:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,that doesnt make sense (on C compiler not in the package set). why isnt it in there?
2005-10-08T05:27:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,normal users don't need it
2005-10-08T05:27:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,ok
2005-10-08T06:42:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,why do you think ap is the worst
2005-10-08T06:42:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,"because it overwrites things without warning, brings back dll hell and is worse than rpm hell"
2005-10-08T06:44:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,hehe.
2005-10-08T06:45:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,are you satisfied now?

2005-10-08T05:49:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,"it's Ubuntu, not Ubuntu linux or Ubuntu GNU/linux"
2005-10-08T05:50:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,I know. ;)
2005-10-12T06:27:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,are meta packages trivial to make? ;)
2005-10-12T06:27:00.000Z,Seveas,kbrooks,extremely
2005-10-12T08:38:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,are you there?

2005-10-12T15:54:00.000Z,kbrooks,Seveas,penguin name was put on long before gentoo linux and the file manager
