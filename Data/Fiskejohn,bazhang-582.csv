2008-02-25T17:55:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,,"I tried Amarok, but it wouldent work! i Could see it was syncing on the Ipod display and it was useing my capacility but no songs where there?"
2008-02-25T17:57:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,,For my ipod what do i have to use: libgpod 0.6.0 og gtkpod ?
2008-02-25T17:58:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,did you read the link I gave you?
2008-02-25T19:51:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,with amarok or rhythm box or what
2008-02-25T19:52:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Ive installed Amarok and it was syncing and useing my ipods capacility but there were no songs on it?
2008-02-25T19:52:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,this is the new nano?
2008-02-25T19:53:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,No its a Ipod clasic 80 GB
2008-02-25T19:57:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,did you mount the ipod via amarok? open amarok then plug in the device and you should see something about mount device top left of front amarok window
2008-02-25T19:58:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Yeah i did mount my ipod correctly and it is adding songs to my ipod. But i can't find them when iam on my ipod.
2008-02-25T19:58:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,if i browse the ipod via system i can see all the songs are in ipod_Control
2008-02-25T19:58:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,you transferred them how? by putting them in the transfer list? and then hitting transfer?
2008-02-25T19:59:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Yeah exacly
2008-02-25T20:01:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Yeah exacly
2008-02-25T20:01:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,and when you turn on your ipod you have zero songs on it--is that correct
2008-02-25T20:02:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,"Thats correct, i can't browse my songs on my ipod"
2008-02-25T20:02:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,and you read that link I gave you earlier I suppose
2008-02-25T20:02:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Yeah the wiki link?
2008-02-25T20:03:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,yeah did you read the wiki
2008-02-25T20:03:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Yeah i did
2008-02-25T20:04:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,this is very odd--I have several models of ipod including that one and they all work with ubuntu gutsy
2008-02-25T20:04:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,"Upgrading to at least libgpod 0.6.0 may solve your problems. Otherwise, have a look at the Gtkpod wiki or follow these steps"
2008-02-25T20:05:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,"I have downloadet libgpod form source forge, but i don't know how to install. Do you think libgpod is a requrement ?"
2008-02-25T20:06:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,not sure as I have never had to follow that wiki--by the time I started using the ipods with ubuntu gutsy it was already fixed
2008-02-25T20:06:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,So you don't know what i can do ?
2008-02-25T20:07:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Well thanks alot for you time :)
2008-02-25T20:07:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,that is very odd let me google for a moment
2008-02-25T20:08:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Thanks alot mate :)
2008-02-25T20:09:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Maybe i do something wrong but i can't see what :(
2008-02-25T20:10:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,did you set your iPod to the correct version in Amarok?
2008-02-25T20:11:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Well i suppose i dident ? Can you explain how?
2008-02-25T20:11:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,can you access the computer presently?
2008-02-25T20:12:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,My computer? Well yeah i am useing it right now :) ?
2008-02-25T20:13:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,can you insert the iPod?
2008-02-25T20:13:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Its already connected :)
2008-02-25T20:14:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,do you see the drop down menu that asks you to identify the iPod model/name?
2008-02-25T20:14:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,IN amarok ?
2008-02-25T20:14:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,aye
2008-02-25T20:15:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,just a moment let me get my iPod ;]
2008-02-25T20:15:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,thanks :)
2008-02-25T20:19:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,"sorry about that--been a while since I synched my iPod ;] ; over the left window there should be a window that shows collections, devices, etc--do you see that?"
2008-02-25T20:19:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Yeah i see :)
2008-02-25T20:19:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,and what does that window say when you are in the devices for your iPod
2008-02-25T20:20:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Media Decive Browser
2008-02-25T20:21:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Configure you media device and then click the connect button to accses you media device. drag an drop bla bla bla
2008-02-25T20:21:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,now go into settings and configure amarok
2008-02-25T20:21:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,I am there
2008-02-25T20:22:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,you need to correctly have amarok list the device or the songs will not show in the iPod as having been transferred--yours should be ipod (color) 80G classic
2008-02-25T20:23:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,So how do i set amarok to detect my Ipod ? Or can i set it ?
2008-02-25T20:24:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,try this--safely remove your ipod--quit amarok then open amarok once more and connect the ipod mounting it via desktop or the way you normally do then identify it again
2008-02-25T20:24:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Ok
2008-02-25T20:25:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,and this is the crucial bit--it has to be the model you have or the songs will not show in the iPod
2008-02-25T20:26:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,hehe does it identify it correctly?
2008-02-25T20:27:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Well it does not identify it at all ?
2008-02-25T20:27:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Do you think i can do this by manuel ?
2008-02-25T20:27:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,go to settings and make sure that it is set to ipod media device
2008-02-25T20:28:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,So i go to configure and click the button 'Media devices'
2008-02-25T20:29:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,next to plugins should be a dropdown menu
2008-02-25T20:29:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,I see
2008-02-25T20:30:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Its set to apple ipod media device
2008-02-25T20:30:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,now close the settings window and make sure it is correctly identify at the top of the devices window
2008-02-25T20:31:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Can i tell you what stands there ?
2008-02-25T20:32:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,please do ;]
2008-02-25T20:32:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Ipod at /dev/sdb1 (Mounted at /media/IPOD)
2008-02-25T20:33:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,"It is the drop down windue you talks about, isen't it ?"
2008-02-25T20:34:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,"aye, now close it"
2008-02-25T20:34:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Amarok ? Shall i close Amarok ?
2008-02-25T20:34:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,no just the settings window--now the main window above devices what does it say
2008-02-25T20:35:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Well at the main window above devices it says Ipod at /dev/sdb1 (Mounted at /media/IPOD)
2008-02-25T20:38:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Well at the main window above devices it says Ipod at /dev/sdb1 (Mounted at /media/IPOD)
2008-02-25T20:41:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Well at the main window above devices it says Ipod at /dev/sdb1 (Mounted at /media/IPOD)baz
2008-02-25T20:42:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,just a moment please--reading a long thread at ubuntuforums on this..
2008-02-25T20:44:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Thanks alot :) Sorry to disturb :D
2008-02-25T20:51:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,"first of all, lets try one more thing--try transferring over some music that is not there yet"
2008-02-25T20:52:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Can i try with one track only?
2008-02-25T20:52:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,aye
2008-02-25T20:53:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Okay its done :)
2008-02-25T20:54:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,now disconnect the ipod safely and see if it shows up--then we have some other stuff to do if not
2008-02-25T20:55:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,"The music still dont apper, but again it use my capacility :("
2008-02-25T20:56:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,aha--that is what I feared--well the libgpod in gutsy is too old--we need the 0.6.0 and gutsy only has 0.5.2-2
2008-02-25T20:56:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,So what i do?
2008-02-25T20:58:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,now comes the fun part-- http://talkingincircles.net/2007/12/26/i-got-my-ipod-classic-to-work-with-amarok/
2008-02-25T20:58:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,hehe :D
2008-02-25T20:58:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,whatever you dont understand be sure to ask and we will help here
2008-02-25T20:59:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Okay :) Thanks

2008-02-25T21:00:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,aye
2008-02-25T21:01:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,"It checked if something was installed, it can get me some installitons i type in Yes ?"
2008-02-25T21:01:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,aye
2008-02-25T21:01:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Ok
2008-02-25T21:03:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,I have to step away for about two minutes--be right back

2008-02-25T21:05:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Seems like its done :)
2008-02-25T21:10:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,you are reading from that link right? you finished downloading those packages?
2008-02-25T21:11:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,"Yeah i do, and yes its done do i type in this now:  tar -zxvf libgpod-0.6.0.tar.gz"
2008-02-25T21:11:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,right but you need to be in the same directory as that file you know
2008-02-25T21:13:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,i downloadet the file to this place: /home/anton/desktop/Rod
2008-02-25T21:13:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,then cd to that directory
2008-02-25T21:14:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,And how is that done? Sorry for newbieneness :(
2008-02-25T21:14:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,currently you should be in home--try a ls and see if the documents you see are familiar
2008-02-25T21:15:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Ohh yeah they are :)
2008-02-25T21:15:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,now type cd Desktop

2008-02-25T21:18:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,It can't find the file i think i have to cd once more !
2008-02-25T21:18:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,do you see the file with ls?
2008-02-25T21:18:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,No ?
2008-02-25T21:18:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,I cd into 'Rod'
2008-02-25T21:19:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,aye that is it
2008-02-25T21:19:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,And now the command :D ?
2008-02-25T21:19:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,yes!
2008-02-25T21:19:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Something indeed happend :D
2008-02-25T21:20:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Done
2008-02-25T21:20:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,now the next command
2008-02-25T21:21:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,and i guess the next again :D ?
2008-02-25T21:21:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,unless we hit a speed bump yes ;]
2008-02-25T21:21:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,hehe :D
2008-02-25T21:22:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,"Okay it did do something i can choose these things:  Now type 'make' to build libgpod 0.6.0,"
2008-02-25T21:22:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,yes and yes
2008-02-25T21:22:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,so i type first 'Make' And then 'Make install' ?
2008-02-25T21:24:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,I did type in 'Make' do i also have to type in 'Make install' ?
2008-02-25T21:24:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,well that is you need to do what the instructions say which is: ./configure first
2008-02-25T21:24:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,I did do the ./configure
2008-02-25T21:24:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,ah okay phew ;]
2008-02-25T21:25:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,:) So i type in  sudo checkinstall ?
2008-02-25T21:25:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,then sudo checkinstall
2008-02-25T21:25:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,:D btw what does sudo stands for :D ?
2008-02-25T21:25:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,super user do (a bit similar to root)
2008-02-25T21:26:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Ohh okay :) Now i get this: Please write a description for the package.
2008-02-25T21:26:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,libgpod 2 Fiskejohn or just libgpod :D ?
2008-02-25T21:27:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,sorry bad joke :D
2008-02-25T21:28:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,libgpod2 with no space and no name ;]
2008-02-25T21:28:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Okay now how do i end it ? it says '... With and empty line or EOF' whats an EOF ?
2008-02-25T21:29:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Okay
2008-02-25T21:30:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,"Wierd i typed in EOF, nothing happend i then clicked enter and it was saying this: Enter a number to change any of them or press ENTER to continue:"
2008-02-25T21:31:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Is that a good or a bad sign?
2008-02-25T21:32:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,now this will different than the instructions just a bit--you need to enter your path to the file and not the one in the instructions
2008-02-25T21:33:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Okay in the instructions it is this: sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib/libgpod.so.3 /usr/lib/libgpod.so.2 and my path is this: /home/anton/Skrivebord/Rod/libgpod-0.6.0
2008-02-25T21:34:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,so will be this: /home/anton/Skrivebord/Rod/libgpod-0.6.0.so.3 /home/anton/Skrivebord/Rod/libgpod-0.6.0.so.2 ?
2008-02-25T21:35:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,right except the back part should be the same as the instructions /usr/lib/libgpod.so.2
2008-02-25T21:36:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,so this :D /home/anton/Skrivebord/Rod/libgpod-0.6.0.so.3 /usr/lib/libgpod.so.2 ? :D ?
2008-02-25T21:37:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,well is the file called libgpod 0.6.0 or without the 0.6.0 (arg my fingers)
2008-02-25T21:37:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,its called libgpod-0.6.0
2008-02-25T21:38:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,then call it that in the command ;]
2008-02-25T21:39:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,so this  is it :D ? /home/anton/Skrivebord/Rod/libgpod-0.6.0.so.3 /usr/lib/libgpod-0.6.0.so.2
2008-02-25T21:41:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,try it though I think it may not work--I believe we have to untar the file in the directory and use the same as the instructions--lets see though
2008-02-25T21:41:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,You were right :( bash: so: command not found
2008-02-25T21:43:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,"I dident understand what you said above, can you tell me once again :) ?"
2008-02-25T21:43:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,I think we missed a step (sorry its late here)
2008-02-25T21:44:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Ohh i am sorry if its a bad time ?
2008-02-25T21:44:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,no its okay
2008-02-25T21:44:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Ohh okay :) But what step we missed ?
2008-02-25T21:45:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,is there file called libgpod.so.3 there?
2008-02-25T21:46:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,a quick ls will reveal if yes ;]
2008-02-25T21:46:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,but i am cd in this anton@anton:~/Skrivebord/Rod/libgpod-0.6.0$
2008-02-25T21:47:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,says 'Command not found'
2008-02-25T21:47:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,did you cd into that folder?
2008-02-25T21:47:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Yeah when i tried the command above it cd into the folder :(
2008-02-25T21:48:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,you tried cd libgpod-0.6.0 ?
2008-02-25T21:49:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,No it was when i used this command /home/anton/Skrivebord/Rod/libgpod-0.6.0.so.3 /usr/lib/libgpod.so.2
2008-02-25T21:49:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,okay well cd into that folder
2008-02-25T21:50:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,oh shit i missed the sudo ln -s /
2008-02-25T21:50:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,please cd into the folder first ;]
2008-02-25T21:50:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,i am in that folder now :)
2008-02-25T21:50:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,anton@anton:~/Skrivebord/Rod/libgpod-0.6.0$
2008-02-25T21:51:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,now try the command except add the total path in the front end and then the back end should be like in the instructions
2008-02-25T21:53:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,something like this: sudo ln -s /home/anton/Skrivebord/Rod/libgpod-0.6.0 /usr/lib/libgpod.so.2 ?
2008-02-25T21:53:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,is there a file libgpod.so.3  in that folder ?
2008-02-25T21:54:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,no sorry :(
2008-02-25T21:57:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,no sorry
2008-02-25T22:00:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,no sorry :(

2008-02-25T22:01:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Okay :)
2008-02-25T22:02:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,from reading ubuntuforums if this does not work (I hope we have the path right) then we need to sudo make install instead of checkinstall
2008-02-25T22:02:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,The link :D ? Something like this?: ln -s /home/anton/Skrivebord/Rod/libgpod-0.6.0 /usr/lib/libgpod-0.6.0.so.2 ?
2008-02-25T22:03:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,arh okay :)
2008-02-25T22:04:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Should i try type into the link :D ?
2008-02-25T22:06:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,lets give it a shot!
2008-02-25T22:06:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Okay i type the link now :D
2008-02-25T22:09:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,"it did ask for password, but when i typed it in nothing happend :("
2008-02-25T22:10:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,you have used sudo before?
2008-02-25T22:10:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Ohh now it says this: File exists
2008-02-25T22:11:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,I mean this is the first time to sudo?
2008-02-25T22:11:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Yeah i guess i never did something in the terminal before :D
2008-02-25T22:12:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,no worries--we all start from there ;]
2008-02-25T22:12:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,it seems that those instructions did not work but we can definitely get this going
2008-02-25T22:13:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,How :D ?
2008-02-25T22:13:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,do you need to take a break?

2008-02-25T22:13:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,I am here just about every day --I think I may have found a much easier way of doing this
2008-02-25T22:14:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Okay :) But i guess you are very tired :D ?
2008-02-25T22:14:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,nah

2008-02-25T22:33:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Okay :)
2008-02-25T22:36:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,that 16 character long string is the fwid

2008-02-25T22:42:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,"Pop up box: fwid dosent seem to be valid, are you sure you want to continue? Yes - No"
2008-02-25T22:44:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,I kinda think i have to say 'Yes' and screw it :D ?

2008-02-25T22:53:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,"okay, now just a moment while I retrieve my iPod"
2008-02-25T22:54:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Ohh this sucks :( http://appdb.winehq.org/appview.php?iAppId=1347
2008-02-25T22:56:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,I will do this as well--so just bear with me
2008-02-25T22:57:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,So you start install iTunes :D ?
2008-02-25T22:57:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,first we need to sudo apt-get install wine from the terminal
2008-02-25T22:57:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,I already have  wine
2008-02-25T22:58:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,then we need to download iTunes for windows
2008-02-25T22:58:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,indeed :D http://appdb.winehq.org/appview.php?iAppId=1347 chek that :(
2008-02-25T22:59:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Cen you tell me where you download iTunes from ? So we got the same version ?
2008-02-25T23:01:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,from the link on that page--then choose the version for xp and vista
2008-02-25T23:02:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,I am downloading the version 7.6 :D
2008-02-25T23:02:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,same here

2008-02-25T23:19:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Ill do
2008-02-25T23:20:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Something odd oppend :?!
2008-02-25T23:21:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,"just type winecfg in the terminal, then cd to where you have downloaded that file and type wine iTunesSetup.exe"
2008-02-25T23:23:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,well i already installed itunes
2008-02-25T23:24:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,I maybe think i have to reboot my PC becouse iTunes wont work :(
2008-02-25T23:26:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,does your iTunes work correctly ?
2008-02-25T23:27:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,still reading up on this ;]
2008-02-25T23:28:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Ohh Well bazhang i already have installed wine and have serverel programs running on wine :) I kinda know how it works :)
2008-02-25T23:30:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,then you are way ahead of me--I will make this iPod deal work though ;]
2008-02-25T23:30:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Offcourse :D Ill just wait :D
2008-02-25T23:32:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,you know how to get this going? double click on iTunes in the file list and it should launch right?
2008-02-25T23:32:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Well i just click on the .exe file and then it should start install
2008-02-25T23:34:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Its to bad it wont work :(
2008-02-25T23:35:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,great idea :) Please tell me if it works :D
2008-02-25T23:35:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,You come back online right ?!
2008-02-25T23:36:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,this works for sure--if you have a windows xp disk then a vm is 100% guaranteed to work--just wanted to avoid that but what the hey this has me pssed off ;]
2008-02-25T23:37:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,i have no vm CD :(
2008-02-25T23:37:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,you have a vm CD ? I don't even know what a vm CD is :(
2008-02-25T23:38:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,aha you misunderstand me--iof you have a xp cd then the vm is in ubuntu and you can do it that way
2008-02-25T23:39:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Na i have no XP Cd :( Sorry
2008-02-25T23:43:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,you still here?
2008-02-25T23:43:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,yeah :)
2008-02-25T23:44:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,you have no XP cds? not from a previous system?
2008-02-25T23:44:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,No it was kinda why i changed to linux :)
2008-02-25T23:44:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,any windows (arg Vista)?
2008-02-25T23:45:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,"No Vista i hate vista more then ever, and i dont have any windows versions at all :( :("
2008-02-25T23:45:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,I hate vista more then anything alse :)
2008-02-25T23:45:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,then the last path seems to be the first one we took which is to sudo make install instead of checkinstall and see how that turns out
2008-02-25T23:46:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Yeah
2008-02-25T23:46:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,So i start with delete the previuos file :() ?
2008-02-25T23:47:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,"I need to take a bit of a break now but will be online again tomorrow--heck any day after today, and if you are around then peopl e here can help as will I --I am going for the virtual machine, and it seems you have learned a bit about linux already even though we are not finished ;]"
2008-02-25T23:47:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Okay well cya :D
2008-02-25T23:48:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Thanks for you kindness and you time :)
2008-02-25T17:55:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,,"I tried Amarok, but it wouldent work! i Could see it was syncing on the Ipod display and it was useing my capacility but no songs where there?"
2008-02-25T17:57:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,,For my ipod what do i have to use: libgpod 0.6.0 og gtkpod ?
2008-02-25T17:58:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,did you read the link I gave you?
2008-02-25T19:51:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,with amarok or rhythm box or what
2008-02-25T19:52:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Ive installed Amarok and it was syncing and useing my ipods capacility but there were no songs on it?
2008-02-25T19:52:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,this is the new nano?
2008-02-25T19:53:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,No its a Ipod clasic 80 GB
2008-02-25T19:57:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,did you mount the ipod via amarok? open amarok then plug in the device and you should see something about mount device top left of front amarok window
2008-02-25T19:58:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Yeah i did mount my ipod correctly and it is adding songs to my ipod. But i can't find them when iam on my ipod.
2008-02-25T19:58:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,if i browse the ipod via system i can see all the songs are in ipod_Control
2008-02-25T19:58:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,you transferred them how? by putting them in the transfer list? and then hitting transfer?
2008-02-25T19:59:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Yeah exacly
2008-02-25T20:01:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Yeah exacly
2008-02-25T20:01:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,and when you turn on your ipod you have zero songs on it--is that correct
2008-02-25T20:02:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,"Thats correct, i can't browse my songs on my ipod"
2008-02-25T20:02:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,and you read that link I gave you earlier I suppose
2008-02-25T20:02:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Yeah the wiki link?
2008-02-25T20:03:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,yeah did you read the wiki
2008-02-25T20:03:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Yeah i did
2008-02-25T20:04:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,this is very odd--I have several models of ipod including that one and they all work with ubuntu gutsy
2008-02-25T20:04:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,"Upgrading to at least libgpod 0.6.0 may solve your problems. Otherwise, have a look at the Gtkpod wiki or follow these steps"
2008-02-25T20:05:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,"I have downloadet libgpod form source forge, but i don't know how to install. Do you think libgpod is a requrement ?"
2008-02-25T20:06:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,not sure as I have never had to follow that wiki--by the time I started using the ipods with ubuntu gutsy it was already fixed
2008-02-25T20:06:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,So you don't know what i can do ?
2008-02-25T20:07:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Well thanks alot for you time :)
2008-02-25T20:07:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,that is very odd let me google for a moment
2008-02-25T20:08:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Thanks alot mate :)
2008-02-25T20:09:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Maybe i do something wrong but i can't see what :(
2008-02-25T20:10:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,did you set your iPod to the correct version in Amarok?
2008-02-25T20:11:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Well i suppose i dident ? Can you explain how?
2008-02-25T20:11:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,can you access the computer presently?
2008-02-25T20:12:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,My computer? Well yeah i am useing it right now :) ?
2008-02-25T20:13:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,can you insert the iPod?
2008-02-25T20:13:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Its already connected :)
2008-02-25T20:14:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,do you see the drop down menu that asks you to identify the iPod model/name?
2008-02-25T20:14:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,IN amarok ?
2008-02-25T20:14:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,aye
2008-02-25T20:15:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,just a moment let me get my iPod ;]
2008-02-25T20:15:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,thanks :)
2008-02-25T20:19:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,"sorry about that--been a while since I synched my iPod ;] ; over the left window there should be a window that shows collections, devices, etc--do you see that?"
2008-02-25T20:19:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Yeah i see :)
2008-02-25T20:19:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,and what does that window say when you are in the devices for your iPod
2008-02-25T20:20:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Media Decive Browser
2008-02-25T20:21:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Configure you media device and then click the connect button to accses you media device. drag an drop bla bla bla
2008-02-25T20:21:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,now go into settings and configure amarok
2008-02-25T20:21:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,I am there
2008-02-25T20:22:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,you need to correctly have amarok list the device or the songs will not show in the iPod as having been transferred--yours should be ipod (color) 80G classic
2008-02-25T20:23:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,So how do i set amarok to detect my Ipod ? Or can i set it ?
2008-02-25T20:24:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,try this--safely remove your ipod--quit amarok then open amarok once more and connect the ipod mounting it via desktop or the way you normally do then identify it again
2008-02-25T20:24:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Ok
2008-02-25T20:25:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,and this is the crucial bit--it has to be the model you have or the songs will not show in the iPod
2008-02-25T20:26:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,hehe does it identify it correctly?
2008-02-25T20:27:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Well it does not identify it at all ?
2008-02-25T20:27:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Do you think i can do this by manuel ?
2008-02-25T20:27:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,go to settings and make sure that it is set to ipod media device
2008-02-25T20:28:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,So i go to configure and click the button 'Media devices'
2008-02-25T20:29:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,next to plugins should be a dropdown menu
2008-02-25T20:29:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,I see
2008-02-25T20:30:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Its set to apple ipod media device
2008-02-25T20:30:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,now close the settings window and make sure it is correctly identify at the top of the devices window
2008-02-25T20:31:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Can i tell you what stands there ?
2008-02-25T20:32:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,please do ;]
2008-02-25T20:32:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Ipod at /dev/sdb1 (Mounted at /media/IPOD)
2008-02-25T20:33:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,"It is the drop down windue you talks about, isen't it ?"
2008-02-25T20:34:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,"aye, now close it"
2008-02-25T20:34:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Amarok ? Shall i close Amarok ?
2008-02-25T20:34:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,no just the settings window--now the main window above devices what does it say
2008-02-25T20:35:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Well at the main window above devices it says Ipod at /dev/sdb1 (Mounted at /media/IPOD)
2008-02-25T20:38:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Well at the main window above devices it says Ipod at /dev/sdb1 (Mounted at /media/IPOD)
2008-02-25T20:41:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Well at the main window above devices it says Ipod at /dev/sdb1 (Mounted at /media/IPOD)baz
2008-02-25T20:42:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,just a moment please--reading a long thread at ubuntuforums on this..
2008-02-25T20:44:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Thanks alot :) Sorry to disturb :D
2008-02-25T20:51:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,"first of all, lets try one more thing--try transferring over some music that is not there yet"
2008-02-25T20:52:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Can i try with one track only?
2008-02-25T20:52:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,aye
2008-02-25T20:53:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Okay its done :)
2008-02-25T20:54:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,now disconnect the ipod safely and see if it shows up--then we have some other stuff to do if not

2008-02-25T20:56:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,aha--that is what I feared--well the libgpod in gutsy is too old--we need the 0.6.0 and gutsy only has 0.5.2-2
2008-02-25T20:56:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,So what i do?

2008-02-25T20:58:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,hehe :D

2008-02-25T21:00:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,aye
2008-02-25T21:01:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,"It checked if something was installed, it can get me some installitons i type in Yes ?"
2008-02-25T21:01:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,aye
2008-02-25T21:01:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Ok
2008-02-25T21:03:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,I have to step away for about two minutes--be right back
2008-02-25T21:03:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Okay cya in a minute :D
2008-02-25T21:05:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Seems like its done :)
2008-02-25T21:10:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,you are reading from that link right? you finished downloading those packages?
2008-02-25T21:11:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,"Yeah i do, and yes its done do i type in this now:  tar -zxvf libgpod-0.6.0.tar.gz"
2008-02-25T21:11:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,right but you need to be in the same directory as that file you know
2008-02-25T21:13:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,i downloadet the file to this place: /home/anton/desktop/Rod
2008-02-25T21:13:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,then cd to that directory
2008-02-25T21:14:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,And how is that done? Sorry for newbieneness :(
2008-02-25T21:14:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,currently you should be in home--try a ls and see if the documents you see are familiar
2008-02-25T21:15:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Ohh yeah they are :)
2008-02-25T21:15:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,now type cd Desktop
2008-02-25T21:16:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Yeah it did it :D
2008-02-25T21:17:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Thats nice :D
2008-02-25T21:18:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,It can't find the file i think i have to cd once more !
2008-02-25T21:18:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,do you see the file with ls?
2008-02-25T21:18:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,No ?
2008-02-25T21:18:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,I cd into 'Rod'
2008-02-25T21:19:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,aye that is it
2008-02-25T21:19:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,And now the command :D ?
2008-02-25T21:19:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,yes!
2008-02-25T21:19:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Something indeed happend :D
2008-02-25T21:20:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Done
2008-02-25T21:20:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,now the next command
2008-02-25T21:21:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,and i guess the next again :D ?
2008-02-25T21:21:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,unless we hit a speed bump yes ;]
2008-02-25T21:21:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,hehe :D
2008-02-25T21:22:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,"Okay it did do something i can choose these things:  Now type 'make' to build libgpod 0.6.0,"
2008-02-25T21:22:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,yes and yes
2008-02-25T21:22:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,so i type first 'Make' And then 'Make install' ?
2008-02-25T21:24:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,I did type in 'Make' do i also have to type in 'Make install' ?
2008-02-25T21:24:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,well that is you need to do what the instructions say which is: ./configure first
2008-02-25T21:24:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,I did do the ./configure
2008-02-25T21:24:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,ah okay phew ;]
2008-02-25T21:25:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,:) So i type in  sudo checkinstall ?
2008-02-25T21:25:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,then sudo checkinstall
2008-02-25T21:25:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,:D btw what does sudo stands for :D ?
2008-02-25T21:25:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,super user do (a bit similar to root)
2008-02-25T21:26:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Ohh okay :) Now i get this: Please write a description for the package.
2008-02-25T21:26:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,libgpod 2 Fiskejohn or just libgpod :D ?
2008-02-25T21:27:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,sorry bad joke :D
2008-02-25T21:28:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,libgpod2 with no space and no name ;]
2008-02-25T21:28:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Okay now how do i end it ? it says '... With and empty line or EOF' whats an EOF ?
2008-02-25T21:29:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Okay
2008-02-25T21:30:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,"Wierd i typed in EOF, nothing happend i then clicked enter and it was saying this: Enter a number to change any of them or press ENTER to continue:"
2008-02-25T21:31:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Is that a good or a bad sign?
2008-02-25T21:32:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,now this will different than the instructions just a bit--you need to enter your path to the file and not the one in the instructions
2008-02-25T21:33:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Okay in the instructions it is this: sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib/libgpod.so.3 /usr/lib/libgpod.so.2 and my path is this: /home/anton/Skrivebord/Rod/libgpod-0.6.0
2008-02-25T21:34:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,so will be this: /home/anton/Skrivebord/Rod/libgpod-0.6.0.so.3 /home/anton/Skrivebord/Rod/libgpod-0.6.0.so.2 ?
2008-02-25T21:35:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,right except the back part should be the same as the instructions /usr/lib/libgpod.so.2
2008-02-25T21:36:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,so this :D /home/anton/Skrivebord/Rod/libgpod-0.6.0.so.3 /usr/lib/libgpod.so.2 ? :D ?
2008-02-25T21:37:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,well is the file called libgpod 0.6.0 or without the 0.6.0 (arg my fingers)
2008-02-25T21:37:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,its called libgpod-0.6.0
2008-02-25T21:38:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,then call it that in the command ;]
2008-02-25T21:39:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,so this  is it :D ? /home/anton/Skrivebord/Rod/libgpod-0.6.0.so.3 /usr/lib/libgpod-0.6.0.so.2
2008-02-25T21:41:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,try it though I think it may not work--I believe we have to untar the file in the directory and use the same as the instructions--lets see though
2008-02-25T21:41:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,You were right :( bash: so: command not found
2008-02-25T21:43:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,"I dident understand what you said above, can you tell me once again :) ?"
2008-02-25T21:43:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,I think we missed a step (sorry its late here)
2008-02-25T21:44:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Ohh i am sorry if its a bad time ?
2008-02-25T21:44:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,no its okay
2008-02-25T21:44:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Ohh okay :) But what step we missed ?
2008-02-25T21:45:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,is there file called libgpod.so.3 there?
2008-02-25T21:46:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,a quick ls will reveal if yes ;]
2008-02-25T21:46:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,but i am cd in this anton@anton:~/Skrivebord/Rod/libgpod-0.6.0$
2008-02-25T21:47:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,says 'Command not found'
2008-02-25T21:47:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,did you cd into that folder?
2008-02-25T21:47:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Yeah when i tried the command above it cd into the folder :(
2008-02-25T21:48:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,you tried cd libgpod-0.6.0 ?
2008-02-25T21:49:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,No it was when i used this command /home/anton/Skrivebord/Rod/libgpod-0.6.0.so.3 /usr/lib/libgpod.so.2
2008-02-25T21:49:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,okay well cd into that folder
2008-02-25T21:50:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,oh shit i missed the sudo ln -s /
2008-02-25T21:50:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,please cd into the folder first ;]
2008-02-25T21:50:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,i am in that folder now :)
2008-02-25T21:50:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,anton@anton:~/Skrivebord/Rod/libgpod-0.6.0$
2008-02-25T21:51:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,now try the command except add the total path in the front end and then the back end should be like in the instructions
2008-02-25T21:53:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,something like this: sudo ln -s /home/anton/Skrivebord/Rod/libgpod-0.6.0 /usr/lib/libgpod.so.2 ?
2008-02-25T21:53:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,is there a file libgpod.so.3  in that folder ?
2008-02-25T21:54:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,no sorry :(
2008-02-25T21:57:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,no sorry
2008-02-25T22:00:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,no sorry :(
2008-02-25T22:00:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,sorry had to step away for a minute--well lets try it out
2008-02-25T22:01:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Okay :)
2008-02-25T22:02:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,from reading ubuntuforums if this does not work (I hope we have the path right) then we need to sudo make install instead of checkinstall
2008-02-25T22:02:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,The link :D ? Something like this?: ln -s /home/anton/Skrivebord/Rod/libgpod-0.6.0 /usr/lib/libgpod-0.6.0.so.2 ?
2008-02-25T22:03:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,arh okay :)
2008-02-25T22:04:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Should i try type into the link :D ?
2008-02-25T22:06:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,lets give it a shot!
2008-02-25T22:06:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Okay i type the link now :D
2008-02-25T22:09:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,"it did ask for password, but when i typed it in nothing happend :("
2008-02-25T22:10:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,you have used sudo before?
2008-02-25T22:10:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Ohh now it says this: File exists
2008-02-25T22:11:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,I mean this is the first time to sudo?
2008-02-25T22:11:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Yeah i guess i never did something in the terminal before :D
2008-02-25T22:12:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,no worries--we all start from there ;]
2008-02-25T22:12:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,it seems that those instructions did not work but we can definitely get this going
2008-02-25T22:13:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,How :D ?
2008-02-25T22:13:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,do you need to take a break?
2008-02-25T22:13:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Na only if you do :D :D
2008-02-25T22:13:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,I am here just about every day --I think I may have found a much easier way of doing this
2008-02-25T22:14:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Okay :) But i guess you are very tired :D ?
2008-02-25T22:14:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,nah
2008-02-25T22:14:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Ohh well :D Iam up for it now if you are :D
2008-02-25T22:16:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,So i download it for linux :D ? And can i close terminal ?
2008-02-25T22:17:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,aye
2008-02-25T22:17:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,let me just try this out first
2008-02-25T22:17:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,okay :9
2008-02-25T22:18:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,:)
2008-02-25T22:22:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,okay! now unpack the file (right click should do) and then click on the icon

2008-02-25T22:57:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,first we need to sudo apt-get install wine from the terminal
2008-02-25T22:57:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,I already have  wine
2008-02-25T22:58:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,then we need to download iTunes for windows
2008-02-25T22:58:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,indeed :D http://appdb.winehq.org/appview.php?iAppId=1347 chek that :(

2008-02-25T23:23:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,well i already installed itunes
2008-02-25T23:24:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,I maybe think i have to reboot my PC becouse iTunes wont work :(
2008-02-25T23:26:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,does your iTunes work correctly ?
2008-02-25T23:27:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,still reading up on this ;]
2008-02-25T23:28:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Ohh Well bazhang i already have installed wine and have serverel programs running on wine :) I kinda know how it works :)
2008-02-25T23:30:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,then you are way ahead of me--I will make this iPod deal work though ;]
2008-02-25T23:30:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Offcourse :D Ill just wait :D
2008-02-25T23:32:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,you know how to get this going? double click on iTunes in the file list and it should launch right?
2008-02-25T23:32:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Well i just click on the .exe file and then it should start install
2008-02-25T23:34:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Its to bad it wont work :(
2008-02-25T23:35:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,great idea :) Please tell me if it works :D
2008-02-25T23:35:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,You come back online right ?!
2008-02-25T23:36:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,this works for sure--if you have a windows xp disk then a vm is 100% guaranteed to work--just wanted to avoid that but what the hey this has me pssed off ;]
2008-02-25T23:37:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,i have no vm CD :(
2008-02-25T23:37:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,you have a vm CD ? I don't even know what a vm CD is :(
2008-02-25T23:38:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,aha you misunderstand me--iof you have a xp cd then the vm is in ubuntu and you can do it that way
2008-02-25T23:39:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Na i have no XP Cd :( Sorry
2008-02-25T23:43:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,you still here?
2008-02-25T23:43:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,yeah :)
2008-02-25T23:44:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,you have no XP cds? not from a previous system?
2008-02-25T23:44:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,No it was kinda why i changed to linux :)
2008-02-25T23:44:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,any windows (arg Vista)?
2008-02-25T23:45:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,"No Vista i hate vista more then ever, and i dont have any windows versions at all :( :("
2008-02-25T23:45:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,I hate vista more then anything alse :)
2008-02-25T23:45:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,then the last path seems to be the first one we took which is to sudo make install instead of checkinstall and see how that turns out
2008-02-25T23:46:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Yeah
2008-02-25T23:46:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,So i start with delete the previuos file :() ?
2008-02-25T23:47:00.000Z,bazhang,Fiskejohn,"I need to take a bit of a break now but will be online again tomorrow--heck any day after today, and if you are around then peopl e here can help as will I --I am going for the virtual machine, and it seems you have learned a bit about linux already even though we are not finished ;]"
2008-02-25T23:47:00.000Z,Fiskejohn,bazhang,Okay well cya :D
