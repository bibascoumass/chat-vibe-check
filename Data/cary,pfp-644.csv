2005-06-25T13:07:00.000Z,cary,pfp,you around?
2005-06-25T13:08:00.000Z,pfp,cary,yep
2005-06-25T13:08:00.000Z,cary,pfp,sweet. someone i sort of know!
2005-06-25T13:08:00.000Z,pfp,cary,:) everything ok?
2005-06-25T13:08:00.000Z,cary,pfp,whats going on. how are things. or something
2005-06-25T13:09:00.000Z,cary,pfp,"life wise yeah, linux wise, i have some issues -=)"
2005-06-25T13:09:00.000Z,cary,pfp,in the mood to try to field some quetions?
2005-06-25T13:09:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"in the mood yes, in the condition, almost - hit me :)"
2005-06-25T13:10:00.000Z,cary,pfp,"hah. well i guess i should boot into lnx to better figure out my questions. one is man..my audio BLows. it works fine in theory, but is very quite and if sounds are repeating they keep fading lower and lower."
2005-06-25T13:11:00.000Z,cary,pfp,"i found a patch on some website, but its basically raw code. its a kernel patch and i have no idea at all what to do with it"
2005-06-25T13:12:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"sounds very strange... (no pun intended), probably a driver problem like you thought"
2005-06-25T13:12:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"patching the kernel is not very difficult, do you know what version teh patch is for?"
2005-06-25T13:12:00.000Z,cary,pfp,"and also..hha...i started trying to mess with installing MOL, and i navigated to something like etc/blah/somefile and i tried to open it to modify a couple of lines just to see if i could do it and i tried 'ed' to edit. is that at all right?"
2005-06-25T13:13:00.000Z,cary,pfp,"i know basically nothing. i THINK it is for hoary 5.04, which is what i am running"
2005-06-25T13:13:00.000Z,cary,pfp,i have no idea where to even start on patching the kernel though
2005-06-25T13:13:00.000Z,pfp,cary,hmm a bit vague eh?
2005-06-25T13:13:00.000Z,cary,pfp,hold. let  me find the dilly
2005-06-25T13:14:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"hoary/5.0.4 is ubuntu's release number, but linux's (= the kernel's) release is a separate thing"
2005-06-25T13:14:00.000Z,pfp,cary,aight
2005-06-25T13:14:00.000Z,cary,pfp,"for reference, where woudl i find that info?"
2005-06-25T13:14:00.000Z,cary,pfp,(so i can come packing when i come back)
2005-06-25T13:14:00.000Z,pfp,cary,type 'uname -r' in a shell
2005-06-25T13:15:00.000Z,cary,pfp,cool. brb
2005-06-25T13:15:00.000Z,pfp,cary,altough i can tell that your hoary has kernel 2.6.10-something
2005-06-25T13:19:00.000Z,cary,pfp,2.6.10-5
2005-06-25T13:20:00.000Z,cary,pfp,the url for these patches is this:  http://seehuhn.de/comp/powerbook/index
2005-06-25T13:20:00.000Z,cary,pfp,is there some need i have of updating my kernel?
2005-06-25T13:21:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"yep, you need to get the source code, apply that patch, compile & install"
2005-06-25T13:21:00.000Z,cary,pfp,no idea how to do that
2005-06-25T13:22:00.000Z,pfp,cary,hopefuly you will soon
2005-06-25T13:22:00.000Z,cary,pfp,"i just changed my audio thing to alsa instead of oss and it started out okay, but it sounds muted and crappy now. like..its maxed out but so soft i can barely hear it"
2005-06-25T13:22:00.000Z,cary,pfp,"i am at your mercy, if you feel so inclinded as to help me"
2005-06-25T13:22:00.000Z,pfp,cary,suresure .)
2005-06-25T13:23:00.000Z,cary,pfp,"the first like..half second of the song sounds fine, then it starts sounding more or less like the ass of a mad bear"
2005-06-25T13:23:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"so, you need the kernel sources, and you need a .tar.gz of those most probably, since ubuntu only carries 2.6.10"
2005-06-25T13:23:00.000Z,cary,pfp,is there some linux site i need to find that will have this kernel?
2005-06-25T13:24:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/ , take 2.6.11.8"
2005-06-25T13:24:00.000Z,pfp,cary,about 35 MB
2005-06-25T13:26:00.000Z,pfp,cary,that's equivalent to searching w/ synaptic
2005-06-25T13:26:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"aah, ubuntu carries sources for 2.6.11 too, great"
2005-06-25T13:27:00.000Z,cary,pfp,in english/linuxdummie
2005-06-25T13:27:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"cancel the kernel.org d/l, also, it's worth playing with alsamixer first, if that doesn't help, we'll compile a kernel"
2005-06-25T13:28:00.000Z,cary,pfp,so i should search for the kernel in apt-cache?
2005-06-25T13:29:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"yep, you can get the kernel sources with apt"
2005-06-25T13:29:00.000Z,cary,pfp,nowi dont knwo where i am looking for this kernel
2005-06-25T13:30:00.000Z,cary,pfp,apt..is that through synaptic?
2005-06-25T13:30:00.000Z,pfp,cary,you need package called linux-source-2.6.11
2005-06-25T13:30:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"yep, synaptic is (the easiest) frontend for APT"
2005-06-25T13:30:00.000Z,cary,pfp,found it
2005-06-25T13:30:00.000Z,cary,pfp,marking it now
2005-06-25T13:31:00.000Z,cary,pfp,woohoo..its downloading
2005-06-25T13:33:00.000Z,cary,pfp,okay i thoguht i applied the new kernel but terminal still says 2.6.10.5
2005-06-25T13:33:00.000Z,cary,pfp,"(i applied, then reloaded everything)"
2005-06-25T13:33:00.000Z,pfp,cary,there's still work to be done... have you ever compiled software / are you familiar with that concept?
2005-06-25T13:34:00.000Z,cary,pfp,"many many moons ago i programmed in like...VB. i compiled there, but it was all visual"
2005-06-25T13:34:00.000Z,cary,pfp,"r0d, i downloaded and applied the thing in synaptic"
2005-06-25T13:35:00.000Z,cary,pfp,"yeah, thats what i used it for. .exes for windows, back in the day"
2005-06-25T13:37:00.000Z,pfp,cary,do you have that 010-sound.patch file around?
2005-06-25T13:38:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"yep, i read that page..  you should save it to a file, eg. in your home directory"
2005-06-25T13:38:00.000Z,cary,pfp,"the code? like, a text doc?"
2005-06-25T13:38:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"yep, it's plain text"
2005-06-25T13:39:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"or right-click on the link -> save as, end result is same"
2005-06-25T13:41:00.000Z,pfp,cary,that package you installed with synaptic created a file called /usr/src/linux-source-2.6.11.tar.bz2
2005-06-25T13:43:00.000Z,cary,pfp,okay...
2005-06-25T13:43:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"you should extract that somewhere where you have about hmm, 300 MB free"
2005-06-25T13:44:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"in terminal, go to that directory and type tar xpjf /usr/src/linux-source-2.6.11.tar.bz2"
2005-06-25T13:44:00.000Z,cary,pfp,okay...so...i find that file in...terminal? the file brosers?
2005-06-25T13:44:00.000Z,cary,pfp,okay
2005-06-25T13:44:00.000Z,pfp,cary,tarminal ofc :)
2005-06-25T13:44:00.000Z,cary,pfp,ofc?
2005-06-25T13:44:00.000Z,pfp,cary,of course
2005-06-25T13:45:00.000Z,cary,pfp,hold: doing so
2005-06-25T13:46:00.000Z,cary,pfp,that mess is running now
2005-06-25T13:46:00.000Z,cary,pfp,i guess its extracting it to that dir?
2005-06-25T13:47:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"yep. as long as you don't see any output, it's extracting"
2005-06-25T13:48:00.000Z,pfp,cary,gag. stop it with Ctrl-C.. and pls paste the last line
2005-06-25T13:48:00.000Z,cary,pfp,it stoppd itself
2005-06-25T13:49:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"you're probably out of disk space, type 'df -h .' in the same directory"
2005-06-25T13:50:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"the source itself takes about 230MB, and compiling some more... hmm, well you have plenty of that"
2005-06-25T13:50:00.000Z,cary,pfp,"what sucks is i think it is using a differernt partition than i wanted it to . i got confused somewhere in installing and i think i lost in the suffle like 10 gigs, if i am using the 5 gig part."
2005-06-25T13:50:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"oh, damn :("
2005-06-25T13:51:00.000Z,pfp,cary,that shouldn't matter here though
2005-06-25T13:51:00.000Z,cary,pfp,not really sure wha tto do about it. im crap at trying to figure stuff out with that install thing
2005-06-25T13:52:00.000Z,pfp,cary,now we need to find out why the source wasn't extracted properly
2005-06-25T13:52:00.000Z,cary,pfp,joy of joys
2005-06-25T13:52:00.000Z,cary,pfp,is it possible i mis-typed?
2005-06-25T13:53:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"hmm, prolly not"
2005-06-25T13:53:00.000Z,pfp,cary,rm -rf linux-source-2.6.11
2005-06-25T13:54:00.000Z,pfp,cary,after that: tar xpjf /usr/src/linux-source-2.6.11.tar.bz2 > tar.out 2>&1
2005-06-25T13:54:00.000Z,cary,pfp,doesnt tell me anythign
2005-06-25T13:54:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"you don't need to, actually it's better not to"
2005-06-25T13:56:00.000Z,pfp,cary,you got permission denied from the  'rm -rf ...' ?
2005-06-25T13:56:00.000Z,cary,pfp,cary@lnx:/usr/src$ rm -rf linux-source-2.6.11
2005-06-25T13:57:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"aah... now i gets it, get out of /usr/src (you could do it there too, but let's try to keep this simple)"
2005-06-25T13:57:00.000Z,cary,pfp,okay
2005-06-25T13:57:00.000Z,cary,pfp,where to
2005-06-25T13:58:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"go to your home folder, then 'mkdir kernel ; cd kernel'"
2005-06-25T13:59:00.000Z,pfp,cary,then re-run that tar...  command
2005-06-25T14:00:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"umm, you're in the root directory (/) now, you should be in your home (/home/yourusername)"
2005-06-25T14:00:00.000Z,pfp,cary,type just 'cd' by itself to get there
2005-06-25T14:00:00.000Z,cary,pfp,could do like cd /~ to make it sure
2005-06-25T14:02:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"great, go to that directory, then the tar... thing"
2005-06-25T14:03:00.000Z,cary,pfp,done
2005-06-25T14:03:00.000Z,cary,pfp,i am getting no output
2005-06-25T14:03:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"ok, that's good"
2005-06-25T14:04:00.000Z,cary,pfp,(i need a cpu meter so i can tell what is going on)
2005-06-25T14:04:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"when it's finished, there should be exactly one dir, named linux-source-2.6.11"
2005-06-25T14:05:00.000Z,cary,pfp,linux-source-2.6.11  tar.out
2005-06-25T14:06:00.000Z,cary,pfp,btw..where in the world are you? i am in the state of alabama. (i know i know. it sounds hickish. birmingham is quite nice though)
2005-06-25T14:06:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"ah yes, good... do an 'ls -l', tar.out should have zero size"
2005-06-25T14:06:00.000Z,cary,pfp,it does have a 0 size
2005-06-25T14:07:00.000Z,pfp,cary,i'm in finland miself
2005-06-25T14:07:00.000Z,cary,pfp,oh man im jealous
2005-06-25T14:07:00.000Z,pfp,cary,:D i demand to know why?
2005-06-25T14:08:00.000Z,cary,pfp,"because finland to me is unknown and i desire to go to the unknown. i love travelling and as i have never been there, i know not that which i [think i might maybe]  desire"
2005-06-25T14:08:00.000Z,cary,pfp,either way i want to go there to take photos
2005-06-25T14:09:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"welcome, english is widely spoken :P and there's lots of nature & stuff"
2005-06-25T14:10:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"bout the kernel, you should cd to that linux-source-2.6.11 dir"
2005-06-25T14:10:00.000Z,cary,pfp,when i get my linux up and running maybe ill book a flight. [WOULD that i had that kind of money lying around] 
2005-06-25T14:10:00.000Z,cary,pfp,doing that now
2005-06-25T14:10:00.000Z,cary,pfp,there
2005-06-25T14:10:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"mmhm, id' be travelling this very moment, if i had the money :)"
2005-06-25T14:11:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"ok, now where's the patch you saved"
2005-06-25T14:11:00.000Z,cary,pfp,lets come up with a massive interntational scheme to steal lots of monies and travel th eworld over
2005-06-25T14:11:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"i'm in, heh"
2005-06-25T14:12:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"ok, now to apply your 1st ever kernel patch: patch -p1 ~/Desktop/patchfile"
2005-06-25T14:13:00.000Z,cary,pfp,"by the by, what is the -pl part of that command"
2005-06-25T14:14:00.000Z,cary,pfp,should i go ahead and apply those other patches on the website before compiling?
2005-06-25T14:15:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"the patch file contains file names and paths, the -p<number> tells patch the depth of dirs to strip from those paths"
2005-06-25T14:16:00.000Z,cary,pfp,shoudl it still be patching?
2005-06-25T14:16:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"ah, made a typo.. ctrl-c it"
2005-06-25T14:16:00.000Z,cary,pfp,done. now what
2005-06-25T14:17:00.000Z,pfp,cary,then: patch -p1 < ~/Desktop/patchfile
2005-06-25T14:18:00.000Z,cary,pfp,i dont knwo about these other patches. my fn key seems to work as it shoudl
2005-06-25T14:19:00.000Z,cary,pfp,"but hey, id rather my cpu be running on full than crippled"
2005-06-25T14:19:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"hmm, if it ain't broken, no need to fix... that cpu patch migh be a good idea though"
2005-06-25T14:19:00.000Z,cary,pfp,roger
2005-06-25T14:19:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"and anything else you'd like to add, heh"
2005-06-25T14:20:00.000Z,cary,pfp,i'd love to add lots of stuff but i havnt a clue what those things are
2005-06-25T14:21:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"same command, yep"
2005-06-25T14:22:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"probably that therm patch is a good idea too, since the author recommends it"
2005-06-25T14:22:00.000Z,cary,pfp,all patches (save the fn key) are done
2005-06-25T14:23:00.000Z,cary,pfp,one step ahead (first time ever!)
2005-06-25T14:27:00.000Z,cary,pfp,now what?
2005-06-25T14:28:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"i was reading some docs on how to make this easy (i know how to compile a kernel 'by hand', but theres a more automated method)"
2005-06-25T14:28:00.000Z,cary,pfp,ahha. sorry to rush. i appreciate your help very much
2005-06-25T14:33:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"ok.... you need to configure the kernel sources before compiling, do: cp /boot/config-`uname -r` .config"
2005-06-25T14:33:00.000Z,pfp,cary,in the linux-2.6... directory
2005-06-25T14:34:00.000Z,pfp,cary,then: make oldconfig
2005-06-25T14:35:00.000Z,pfp,cary,ah... you need some tools
2005-06-25T14:36:00.000Z,pfp,cary,sudo apt-get install build-essential kernel-package fakeroot
2005-06-25T14:39:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"yep, now the previous command"
2005-06-25T14:40:00.000Z,cary,pfp,what is that?
2005-06-25T14:40:00.000Z,cary,pfp,i assume i hit yes...?
2005-06-25T14:40:00.000Z,cary,pfp,ahh..its something about the thermal thin
2005-06-25T14:42:00.000Z,cary,pfp,i sent you the whole thing. i assume its just asking about proccesor stuff. like asking if iw ant to do that
2005-06-25T14:42:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"you can just go w/ the defaults, ie. press enter for everything"
2005-06-25T14:43:00.000Z,cary,pfp,done with that bit
2005-06-25T14:46:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"ok, you should be ready to compile: make-kpkg kernel_image"
2005-06-25T14:46:00.000Z,cary,pfp,from what dir
2005-06-25T14:47:00.000Z,pfp,cary,in the same linux-2.6.xx dir
2005-06-25T14:47:00.000Z,pfp,cary,compiling will take quite a while then
2005-06-25T14:47:00.000Z,cary,pfp,doing it now presumably
2005-06-25T14:48:00.000Z,pfp,cary,it should also print out lots of stuff; don't get scared :)
2005-06-25T14:49:00.000Z,cary,pfp,oh its printing. its printing like the wind blows
2005-06-25T15:02:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"i have to go (i'm moving), but i'll be around later today (or whatever the timezone)"
2005-06-25T15:03:00.000Z,cary,pfp,or is there some place that can show me where to go from here?
2005-06-25T15:03:00.000Z,cary,pfp,and thank you so much.
2005-06-25T15:18:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"heh, still here, though i'm really out in 10min.  ..."
2005-06-25T15:19:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"after it's compiled, you need to 1) install the kernel package 2) make sure your boot loader is ok. i actually forgot that you're on a Mac; that makes any advice on LILO or GRUB useless to you"
2005-06-25T15:19:00.000Z,cary,pfp,and lsuactiafner was saying i have more junks to do after this
2005-06-25T15:21:00.000Z,cary,pfp,good to know its apparently not possible for me to have janekd this up yet
2005-06-25T15:22:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"yep, you need sudo / root to break anything ,)"
2005-06-25T15:24:00.000Z,cary,pfp,"is installing the kernel especially hard, and how do i check my boot loader?"
2005-06-25T15:26:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"actually, heh, i don't remember, it's been a few years since i had linux on a mac (pc differs in this vs. mac vs. other architectures)"
2005-06-25T15:27:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"hopefully i'll have a chance to check that later, now i _really_ have to attend real-life stuff... ->"
2005-06-26T13:56:00.000Z,cary,pfp,you around? haha
2005-06-28T08:48:00.000Z,pfp,cary,hi (i'm finally back on the net)
2005-06-28T08:48:00.000Z,cary,pfp,so..i finally compiled my kernel with those patches and that kernal wont boot
2005-06-28T08:49:00.000Z,pfp,cary,horrible :) took whole weekend
2005-06-28T08:49:00.000Z,cary,pfp,where did you come from and where did you go?
2005-06-28T08:49:00.000Z,pfp,cary,you got it installed though?
2005-06-28T08:51:00.000Z,pfp,cary,i moved about 5km further north inside helsinki.... have to spend a few months at my parent's place because a commune i lived in got a bit sour
2005-06-28T08:52:00.000Z,cary,pfp,yheah i got it installed!
2005-06-28T08:52:00.000Z,pfp,cary,what error does it give then?
2005-06-28T08:52:00.000Z,cary,pfp,ill need to reboot to write it down
2005-06-28T08:53:00.000Z,pfp,cary,a digital foto of the boot stuff maybe?
2005-06-28T08:53:00.000Z,cary,pfp,what kind of commune. lviing in teh southeast usa i dont real;ly get a whole lot of that
2005-06-28T08:54:00.000Z,cary,pfp,sure thing
2005-06-28T08:56:00.000Z,cary,pfp,brb!
2005-06-28T09:04:00.000Z,cary,pfp,you there?
2005-06-28T09:07:00.000Z,pfp,cary,yep
2005-06-28T09:07:00.000Z,cary,pfp,oaky
2005-06-28T09:08:00.000Z,pfp,cary,sure
2005-06-28T09:10:00.000Z,cary,pfp,basically it gets to that point and just sits there
2005-06-28T09:12:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"heh, i dont understand any of that actually :/ the messages are probably all mac-specific"
2005-06-28T09:12:00.000Z,cary,pfp,awesome.
2005-06-28T09:13:00.000Z,cary,pfp,how ic an i go back the the kernel i used to have as my default
2005-06-28T09:13:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"hmm, maybe you could try compiling a kernel without any patches, to see if they cause the error"
2005-06-28T09:14:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"you'd have to check yaboot's configuration (pc's use GRUB instead) or ask someone who knows yaboot, sorry"
2005-06-28T09:15:00.000Z,pfp,cary,maybe  http://www.askdavetaylor.com/tweak_yaboot_so_mac_os_x_is_my_default_os_not_ubuntu_or_yellow_dog_linux.html
2005-06-28T09:16:00.000Z,cary,pfp,thanks!
2005-06-28T09:25:00.000Z,cary,pfp,so how would i restore my old kernel to be the only kernel?
2005-06-28T09:26:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"oh yeah, the commune.. we had like 4 guys, aged 23-26 years; a maths student, an unemployed musician, would-be history student and meself"
2005-06-28T09:26:00.000Z,pfp,cary,did you install it with dpkg -i file.deb ?
2005-06-28T09:27:00.000Z,cary,pfp,whatever the make-???? command is on the howto page
2005-06-28T09:27:00.000Z,pfp,cary,'make-kpgk kernel_image' ?
2005-06-28T09:28:00.000Z,cary,pfp,but commune...does that mean you guys just live in the same area or was there some like...Goal of the commune? some binding tie that caused it to exist?
2005-06-28T09:28:00.000Z,cary,pfp,yes. that
2005-06-28T09:30:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"no not really, just 4 ~friends sharing a flat... turned out the music guy had a habit of flipping out and getting violent if he drunk too much... and being metal fans, they used to do that heh"
2005-06-28T09:31:00.000Z,cary,pfp,word. ye olde metal(e) fans(e)
2005-06-28T09:32:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"make-kpkg kernel_image just builds a kernel package in a file called linux-image_something.deb, usually install that file to your system with like 'dpkg -i linux-image_etcetera.deb'"
2005-06-28T09:33:00.000Z,pfp,cary,i'm more into electro / hiphop / soul meself.. altough i digest almost anything :)
2005-06-28T09:34:00.000Z,pfp,cary,ill have a look at the howto
2005-06-28T09:34:00.000Z,cary,pfp,"what sort of bands/people/djs?  also, you are a good man to accomodate my laziness. (in reality im carrying on two conversations that are non-nerd)"
2005-06-28T09:37:00.000Z,cary,pfp,dpkg -i linux-image-2.6.8.1_custom.1.0_i386.deb
2005-06-28T09:37:00.000Z,cary,pfp,but i changed the name to the .deb that i actually had
2005-06-28T09:38:00.000Z,pfp,cary,ok. did you (have to) tweak anything after that?
2005-06-28T09:38:00.000Z,cary,pfp,no. it all installed as it woudl by default
2005-06-28T09:41:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"can you still boot to ubuntu with the old kernel, or does yaboot only show the nwe one besides os x?"
2005-06-28T09:42:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"stuff like aphex twin, legowelt, 8bit rockers, jazzanova"
2005-06-28T09:42:00.000Z,cary,pfp,cool. do you know nightmares on wax?
2005-06-28T09:42:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"oh yeah, they're great :)"
2005-06-28T09:42:00.000Z,cary,pfp,agreed.
2005-06-28T09:43:00.000Z,cary,pfp,warp has a lot of great stuff on it.
2005-06-28T09:43:00.000Z,cary,pfp,the most main stream thing i have heard and liked lately is john legend. reminds me of old shcool lauren hill
2005-06-28T09:43:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"cool, i have to check that out"
2005-06-28T09:46:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"you should be able to remove the new one with 'dpkg --remove package_name', if everything goes as planned, that automatocally configures yaboot to list your old kernel"
2005-06-28T09:47:00.000Z,pfp,cary,you can find out package_name with 'dpkg --get-selections | grep linux-image'
2005-06-28T09:47:00.000Z,cary,pfp,its got like..normal pop feel to it which i normally dont like a lot but i liked it enough to buy it from itunes.
2005-06-28T09:50:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"hmm, you might want to back up your current yaboot.conf, altough it seems the kernel packages can handle it by themselves"
2005-06-28T09:51:00.000Z,cary,pfp,"yeah, uh how?"
2005-06-28T09:51:00.000Z,pfp,cary,yep
2005-06-28T09:52:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"between removing the kernel and reboting, it would be wise to check that the new yaboot conf is sane"
2005-06-28T09:56:00.000Z,pfp,cary,or just 'cp yaboot.conf yaboot.conf.bak' (if you were talking about backing it up?)
2005-06-28T09:57:00.000Z,cary,pfp,i meant how to check it. oh i see what you mean. yeah. ill do that. i meant to see if it was still okay
2005-06-28T09:57:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"in the terminal, you can view files with 'less filename'"
2005-06-28T09:59:00.000Z,cary,pfp,ahha! so many things i dont know
2005-06-28T10:01:00.000Z,pfp,cary,a world of knowledge awaits... :)
2005-06-28T10:03:00.000Z,pfp,cary,be back soon...
2005-06-28T10:07:00.000Z,cary,pfp,okay
2005-06-28T10:38:00.000Z,cary,pfp,lemme know when youa re back if there is any chance you read this
2005-06-28T10:39:00.000Z,pfp,cary,here
2005-06-28T10:39:00.000Z,cary,pfp,i removed the image
2005-06-28T10:39:00.000Z,cary,pfp,but i dont exactly know what im looking for in yaboot.conf. do you have any idea?
2005-06-28T10:41:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"just that still specifies your old image, correct filename etc"
2005-06-28T10:41:00.000Z,pfp,cary,press q .)
2005-06-28T10:43:00.000Z,pfp,cary,you could check differences between the conf files with 'diff yaboot.conf yaboot.conf.old'
2005-06-28T10:44:00.000Z,pfp,cary,but i recall nalioth saying the conf is most probably ok
2005-06-28T10:45:00.000Z,pfp,cary,q doesn't work? hmm
2005-06-28T10:45:00.000Z,pfp,cary,could you pastebin the conf somewhere?
2005-06-28T10:46:00.000Z,cary,pfp,"btw, whatsure"
2005-06-28T10:46:00.000Z,cary,pfp,sure
2005-06-28T10:48:00.000Z,cary,pfp,http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/150
2005-06-28T10:49:00.000Z,cary,pfp,but why what
2005-06-28T10:50:00.000Z,pfp,cary,just referring to that WIN_ME :)
2005-06-28T10:52:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"hmm, are /boot/vmlinux and /boot/vmlinux.old symlinks to some other files?"
2005-06-28T10:54:00.000Z,cary,pfp,im not realy sure
2005-06-28T10:56:00.000Z,cary,pfp,im not really sure what thye are i guess.
2005-06-28T10:56:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"you can check it with 'ls -l' inside /boot. if the file names have ' -> vmlinux-123.ver.sion', they are symbolic links to those files"
2005-06-28T10:57:00.000Z,pfp,cary,symlinks in unix are about the same as aliases in Mac OS(X)
2005-06-28T10:57:00.000Z,cary,pfp,ahha.
2005-06-28T10:58:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"the idea is that installing a new kernel just changes the symlink, so there is no need to change the file names inside yaboot.conf"
2005-06-28T10:58:00.000Z,cary,pfp,im going to paste the ls -l result
2005-06-28T10:58:00.000Z,pfp,cary,good
2005-06-28T10:59:00.000Z,cary,pfp,done.
2005-06-28T11:04:00.000Z,cary,pfp,make any sense?
2005-06-28T11:04:00.000Z,pfp,cary,yep
2005-06-28T11:04:00.000Z,cary,pfp,so can you translate into noob?
2005-06-28T11:06:00.000Z,cary,pfp,so should i risk a reboot?
2005-06-28T11:06:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"so, yaboot.conf specifies two kernels; /boot/vmlinux and /boot/vmlinux.old, whenever you 'dpkg -i linux-image_blaa.deb', the installer changes those symlinks to point to /boot/vmlinux-blaa.ver.sion"
2005-06-28T11:08:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"it would be safe to add a yaboot.conf section that points directly to vmlinux-2.6.10-5-powerpc (the original kernel), that way you always have a safe fallback"
2005-06-28T11:08:00.000Z,cary,pfp,so that'd be like pasting in a new area of the conf file with a full path to the original kernel
2005-06-28T11:10:00.000Z,pfp,cary,yep... check 153
2005-06-28T11:11:00.000Z,cary,pfp,~^
2005-06-28T11:13:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"yep, it should (ofc you should write your own, but dealing with boot loaders is a bit risky (as if i knew any better))"
2005-06-28T11:19:00.000Z,cary,pfp,no love
2005-06-28T11:19:00.000Z,cary,pfp,do i have to update the bootstrap or anything?
2005-06-28T11:19:00.000Z,pfp,cary,booting to 'original' didn't work?
2005-06-28T11:20:00.000Z,pfp,cary,or was there none offered?
2005-06-28T11:21:00.000Z,cary,pfp,the site you sent me about osx default mentions this: pfp
2005-06-28T11:22:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"ah, yes, didn't realize that"
2005-06-28T11:23:00.000Z,pfp,cary,yep
2005-06-28T11:24:00.000Z,pfp,cary,that 'file not found' probably came because there's no /boot/vmlinux
2005-06-28T11:25:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"hmm don't think so... looking at the picture, the bootloader seemed to load it fine, but then the kernel itself seemed to get trouble"
2005-06-28T11:25:00.000Z,cary,pfp,yeah..that was optimism. hah
2005-06-28T11:27:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"hmm, maybe the command is called something else on ubuntu... anyway, it reads yaboot.conf and prolly some other stuff and writes it to a location on your disk, where yaboot can find it when booting"
2005-06-28T11:27:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"ybin should be an executable file (ie. command), not a directory"
2005-06-28T11:29:00.000Z,pfp,cary, :)
2005-06-28T11:30:00.000Z,pfp,cary,luck
2005-06-28T11:41:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"mmm that's because /boot/vmlinux doesn't exist, it was probably removed when you dpkg --remove'd the custom kernel"
2005-06-28T11:42:00.000Z,cary,pfp,shoudl i put a manual path? im not really sure the boto strap isbeing updated
2005-06-28T11:42:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"so, if you'd like to use the Linux entry for booting linux, you could recreate the symlink"
2005-06-28T11:43:00.000Z,pfp,cary,did you see the 'original' there now?
2005-06-28T11:43:00.000Z,cary,pfp,how do i check my active kernel version again?
2005-06-28T11:43:00.000Z,pfp,cary,uname -r
2005-06-28T11:44:00.000Z,cary,pfp,so...i pasted the contents of my boot dir
2005-06-28T11:46:00.000Z,cary,pfp,one thing im pissed about is i had my hd partitioned to use number 5 (according to the install booter) but it ended up using 6 (ddidnt realzie that for a while)..so lost 10 gigs (whihc was the partition i had set for linux)
2005-06-28T11:48:00.000Z,cary,pfp,so how woudl i recreat the symlink?
2005-06-28T11:49:00.000Z,pfp,cary,ok... (that partition thing might take a while to solve)
2005-06-28T11:49:00.000Z,cary,pfp,yeha. i am counting it lost for now
2005-06-28T11:49:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"cd /boot, then 'ln -s vmlinux-2.6.10-5-powerpc vmlinux'"
2005-06-28T11:52:00.000Z,cary,pfp,brb
2005-06-28T11:54:00.000Z,cary,pfp,well..i am booted into osx
2005-06-28T11:55:00.000Z,pfp,cary,cool
2005-06-28T12:00:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"heh, hmm"
2005-06-28T12:01:00.000Z,pfp,cary,'Linux' probably fails because the initrd= line is commented out there
2005-06-28T12:02:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"original should work though, 'tis strange"
2005-06-28T12:03:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"i guess it would be safe, until something changes the vmlinux.old link to point somewhere else"
2005-06-28T12:09:00.000Z,cary,pfp," guess it worked. i had only the one option, and it boots. took long enough right?"
2005-06-28T12:09:00.000Z,pfp,cary,rite
2005-06-28T12:10:00.000Z,cary,pfp,but my sound still blows
2005-06-28T12:11:00.000Z,pfp,cary,did you try the hoarysondfix thing?
2005-06-28T12:13:00.000Z,pfp,cary,ah
2005-06-28T12:13:00.000Z,pfp,cary,lol
2005-06-28T12:14:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"probably the kernel fix si what you need, since _all_ sound is f'd up"
2005-06-28T12:16:00.000Z,cary,pfp,is ALL linux software open source and free or just most of it?
2005-06-28T12:16:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"eya, you shouldn't have to figh kernels and bootloaders on your ~1st day on linux"
2005-06-28T12:17:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"most, but there's closed source too, like acrobat reader, some games"
2005-06-28T12:17:00.000Z,pfp,cary,i has to go to work...
2005-06-28T12:18:00.000Z,pfp,cary,PM me if something comes up
2005-06-23T13:04:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"try clicking on the desktop (to give it keyboard focus), then Ctrl-R (if using gnome)"
2005-06-25T13:07:00.000Z,cary,pfp,you around?
2005-06-25T13:08:00.000Z,pfp,cary,yep
2005-06-25T13:08:00.000Z,cary,pfp,sweet. someone i sort of know!
2005-06-25T13:08:00.000Z,pfp,cary,:) everything ok?
2005-06-25T13:08:00.000Z,cary,pfp,whats going on. how are things. or something
2005-06-25T13:09:00.000Z,cary,pfp,"life wise yeah, linux wise, i have some issues -=)"
2005-06-25T13:09:00.000Z,cary,pfp,in the mood to try to field some quetions?
2005-06-25T13:09:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"in the mood yes, in the condition, almost - hit me :)"
2005-06-25T13:10:00.000Z,cary,pfp,"hah. well i guess i should boot into lnx to better figure out my questions. one is man..my audio BLows. it works fine in theory, but is very quite and if sounds are repeating they keep fading lower and lower."
2005-06-25T13:11:00.000Z,cary,pfp,"i found a patch on some website, but its basically raw code. its a kernel patch and i have no idea at all what to do with it"
2005-06-25T13:12:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"sounds very strange... (no pun intended), probably a driver problem like you thought"
2005-06-25T13:12:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"patching the kernel is not very difficult, do you know what version teh patch is for?"
2005-06-25T13:12:00.000Z,cary,pfp,"and also..hha...i started trying to mess with installing MOL, and i navigated to something like etc/blah/somefile and i tried to open it to modify a couple of lines just to see if i could do it and i tried 'ed' to edit. is that at all right?"
2005-06-25T13:13:00.000Z,cary,pfp,"i know basically nothing. i THINK it is for hoary 5.04, which is what i am running"
2005-06-25T13:13:00.000Z,cary,pfp,i have no idea where to even start on patching the kernel though
2005-06-25T13:13:00.000Z,pfp,cary,hmm a bit vague eh?
2005-06-25T13:13:00.000Z,cary,pfp,hold. let  me find the dilly
2005-06-25T13:14:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"hoary/5.0.4 is ubuntu's release number, but linux's (= the kernel's) release is a separate thing"
2005-06-25T13:14:00.000Z,pfp,cary,aight
2005-06-25T13:14:00.000Z,cary,pfp,"for reference, where woudl i find that info?"
2005-06-25T13:14:00.000Z,cary,pfp,(so i can come packing when i come back)
2005-06-25T13:14:00.000Z,pfp,cary,type 'uname -r' in a shell
2005-06-25T13:15:00.000Z,cary,pfp,cool. brb
2005-06-25T13:15:00.000Z,pfp,cary,altough i can tell that your hoary has kernel 2.6.10-something
2005-06-25T13:19:00.000Z,cary,pfp,2.6.10-5
2005-06-25T13:20:00.000Z,cary,pfp,the url for these patches is this:  http://seehuhn.de/comp/powerbook/index
2005-06-25T13:20:00.000Z,cary,pfp,is there some need i have of updating my kernel?
2005-06-25T13:21:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"yep, you need to get the source code, apply that patch, compile & install"
2005-06-25T13:21:00.000Z,cary,pfp,no idea how to do that
2005-06-25T13:22:00.000Z,pfp,cary,hopefuly you will soon
2005-06-25T13:22:00.000Z,cary,pfp,"i just changed my audio thing to alsa instead of oss and it started out okay, but it sounds muted and crappy now. like..its maxed out but so soft i can barely hear it"
2005-06-25T13:22:00.000Z,cary,pfp,"i am at your mercy, if you feel so inclinded as to help me"
2005-06-25T13:22:00.000Z,pfp,cary,suresure .)
2005-06-25T13:23:00.000Z,cary,pfp,"the first like..half second of the song sounds fine, then it starts sounding more or less like the ass of a mad bear"
2005-06-25T13:23:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"so, you need the kernel sources, and you need a .tar.gz of those most probably, since ubuntu only carries 2.6.10"
2005-06-25T13:23:00.000Z,cary,pfp,is there some linux site i need to find that will have this kernel?
2005-06-25T13:24:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/ , take 2.6.11.8"
2005-06-25T13:24:00.000Z,pfp,cary,about 35 MB
2005-06-25T13:26:00.000Z,pfp,cary,that's equivalent to searching w/ synaptic
2005-06-25T13:26:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"aah, ubuntu carries sources for 2.6.11 too, great"
2005-06-25T13:27:00.000Z,cary,pfp,in english/linuxdummie
2005-06-25T13:27:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"cancel the kernel.org d/l, also, it's worth playing with alsamixer first, if that doesn't help, we'll compile a kernel"
2005-06-25T13:28:00.000Z,cary,pfp,so i should search for the kernel in apt-cache?
2005-06-25T13:29:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"yep, you can get the kernel sources with apt"
2005-06-25T13:29:00.000Z,cary,pfp,nowi dont knwo where i am looking for this kernel
2005-06-25T13:30:00.000Z,cary,pfp,apt..is that through synaptic?
2005-06-25T13:30:00.000Z,pfp,cary,you need package called linux-source-2.6.11
2005-06-25T13:30:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"yep, synaptic is (the easiest) frontend for APT"
2005-06-25T13:30:00.000Z,cary,pfp,found it
2005-06-25T13:30:00.000Z,cary,pfp,marking it now
2005-06-25T13:31:00.000Z,cary,pfp,woohoo..its downloading
2005-06-25T13:33:00.000Z,cary,pfp,okay i thoguht i applied the new kernel but terminal still says 2.6.10.5
2005-06-25T13:33:00.000Z,cary,pfp,"(i applied, then reloaded everything)"
2005-06-25T13:33:00.000Z,pfp,cary,there's still work to be done... have you ever compiled software / are you familiar with that concept?
2005-06-25T13:34:00.000Z,cary,pfp,"many many moons ago i programmed in like...VB. i compiled there, but it was all visual"
2005-06-25T13:34:00.000Z,cary,pfp,"r0d, i downloaded and applied the thing in synaptic"
2005-06-25T13:35:00.000Z,cary,pfp,"yeah, thats what i used it for. .exes for windows, back in the day"
2005-06-25T13:37:00.000Z,pfp,cary,do you have that 010-sound.patch file around?
2005-06-25T13:38:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"yep, i read that page..  you should save it to a file, eg. in your home directory"
2005-06-25T13:38:00.000Z,cary,pfp,"the code? like, a text doc?"
2005-06-25T13:38:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"yep, it's plain text"
2005-06-25T13:39:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"or right-click on the link -> save as, end result is same"
2005-06-25T13:41:00.000Z,pfp,cary,that package you installed with synaptic created a file called /usr/src/linux-source-2.6.11.tar.bz2
2005-06-25T13:43:00.000Z,cary,pfp,okay...
2005-06-25T13:43:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"you should extract that somewhere where you have about hmm, 300 MB free"
2005-06-25T13:44:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"in terminal, go to that directory and type tar xpjf /usr/src/linux-source-2.6.11.tar.bz2"
2005-06-25T13:44:00.000Z,cary,pfp,okay...so...i find that file in...terminal? the file brosers?
2005-06-25T13:44:00.000Z,cary,pfp,okay
2005-06-25T13:44:00.000Z,pfp,cary,tarminal ofc :)
2005-06-25T13:44:00.000Z,cary,pfp,ofc?
2005-06-25T13:44:00.000Z,pfp,cary,of course
2005-06-25T13:45:00.000Z,cary,pfp,hold: doing so
2005-06-25T13:46:00.000Z,cary,pfp,that mess is running now
2005-06-25T13:46:00.000Z,cary,pfp,i guess its extracting it to that dir?
2005-06-25T13:47:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"yep. as long as you don't see any output, it's extracting"
2005-06-25T13:48:00.000Z,pfp,cary,gag. stop it with Ctrl-C.. and pls paste the last line
2005-06-25T13:48:00.000Z,cary,pfp,it stoppd itself
2005-06-25T13:49:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"you're probably out of disk space, type 'df -h .' in the same directory"
2005-06-25T13:50:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"the source itself takes about 230MB, and compiling some more... hmm, well you have plenty of that"
2005-06-25T13:50:00.000Z,cary,pfp,"what sucks is i think it is using a differernt partition than i wanted it to . i got confused somewhere in installing and i think i lost in the suffle like 10 gigs, if i am using the 5 gig part."
2005-06-25T13:50:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"oh, damn :("
2005-06-25T13:51:00.000Z,pfp,cary,that shouldn't matter here though
2005-06-25T13:51:00.000Z,cary,pfp,not really sure wha tto do about it. im crap at trying to figure stuff out with that install thing
2005-06-25T13:52:00.000Z,pfp,cary,now we need to find out why the source wasn't extracted properly
2005-06-25T13:52:00.000Z,cary,pfp,joy of joys
2005-06-25T13:52:00.000Z,cary,pfp,is it possible i mis-typed?
2005-06-25T13:53:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"hmm, prolly not"
2005-06-25T13:53:00.000Z,pfp,cary,rm -rf linux-source-2.6.11
2005-06-25T13:54:00.000Z,pfp,cary,after that: tar xpjf /usr/src/linux-source-2.6.11.tar.bz2 > tar.out 2>&1
2005-06-25T13:54:00.000Z,cary,pfp,doesnt tell me anythign
2005-06-25T13:54:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"you don't need to, actually it's better not to"
2005-06-25T13:56:00.000Z,pfp,cary,you got permission denied from the  'rm -rf ...' ?
2005-06-25T13:56:00.000Z,cary,pfp,cary@lnx:/usr/src$ rm -rf linux-source-2.6.11
2005-06-25T13:57:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"aah... now i gets it, get out of /usr/src (you could do it there too, but let's try to keep this simple)"
2005-06-25T13:57:00.000Z,cary,pfp,okay
2005-06-25T13:57:00.000Z,cary,pfp,where to
2005-06-25T13:58:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"go to your home folder, then 'mkdir kernel ; cd kernel'"
2005-06-25T13:59:00.000Z,pfp,cary,then re-run that tar...  command
2005-06-25T14:00:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"umm, you're in the root directory (/) now, you should be in your home (/home/yourusername)"
2005-06-25T14:00:00.000Z,pfp,cary,type just 'cd' by itself to get there
2005-06-25T14:00:00.000Z,cary,pfp,could do like cd /~ to make it sure
2005-06-25T14:02:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"great, go to that directory, then the tar... thing"
2005-06-25T14:03:00.000Z,cary,pfp,done
2005-06-25T14:03:00.000Z,cary,pfp,i am getting no output
2005-06-25T14:03:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"ok, that's good"
2005-06-25T14:04:00.000Z,cary,pfp,(i need a cpu meter so i can tell what is going on)
2005-06-25T14:04:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"when it's finished, there should be exactly one dir, named linux-source-2.6.11"
2005-06-25T14:05:00.000Z,cary,pfp,linux-source-2.6.11  tar.out
2005-06-25T14:06:00.000Z,cary,pfp,btw..where in the world are you? i am in the state of alabama. (i know i know. it sounds hickish. birmingham is quite nice though)
2005-06-25T14:06:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"ah yes, good... do an 'ls -l', tar.out should have zero size"
2005-06-25T14:06:00.000Z,cary,pfp,it does have a 0 size
2005-06-25T14:07:00.000Z,pfp,cary,i'm in finland miself
2005-06-25T14:07:00.000Z,cary,pfp,oh man im jealous
2005-06-25T14:07:00.000Z,pfp,cary,:D i demand to know why?
2005-06-25T14:08:00.000Z,cary,pfp,"because finland to me is unknown and i desire to go to the unknown. i love travelling and as i have never been there, i know not that which i [think i might maybe]  desire"
2005-06-25T14:08:00.000Z,cary,pfp,either way i want to go there to take photos
2005-06-25T14:09:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"welcome, english is widely spoken :P and there's lots of nature & stuff"
2005-06-25T14:10:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"bout the kernel, you should cd to that linux-source-2.6.11 dir"
2005-06-25T14:10:00.000Z,cary,pfp,when i get my linux up and running maybe ill book a flight. [WOULD that i had that kind of money lying around] 
2005-06-25T14:10:00.000Z,cary,pfp,doing that now
2005-06-25T14:10:00.000Z,cary,pfp,there
2005-06-25T14:10:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"mmhm, id' be travelling this very moment, if i had the money :)"
2005-06-25T14:11:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"ok, now where's the patch you saved"
2005-06-25T14:11:00.000Z,cary,pfp,lets come up with a massive interntational scheme to steal lots of monies and travel th eworld over
2005-06-25T14:11:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"i'm in, heh"
2005-06-25T14:12:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"ok, now to apply your 1st ever kernel patch: patch -p1 ~/Desktop/patchfile"
2005-06-25T14:13:00.000Z,cary,pfp,"by the by, what is the -pl part of that command"
2005-06-25T14:14:00.000Z,cary,pfp,should i go ahead and apply those other patches on the website before compiling?
2005-06-25T14:15:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"the patch file contains file names and paths, the -p<number> tells patch the depth of dirs to strip from those paths"
2005-06-25T14:16:00.000Z,cary,pfp,shoudl it still be patching?
2005-06-25T14:16:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"ah, made a typo.. ctrl-c it"
2005-06-25T14:16:00.000Z,cary,pfp,done. now what
2005-06-25T14:17:00.000Z,pfp,cary,then: patch -p1 < ~/Desktop/patchfile
2005-06-25T14:18:00.000Z,cary,pfp,i dont knwo about these other patches. my fn key seems to work as it shoudl
2005-06-25T14:19:00.000Z,cary,pfp,"but hey, id rather my cpu be running on full than crippled"
2005-06-25T14:19:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"hmm, if it ain't broken, no need to fix... that cpu patch migh be a good idea though"
2005-06-25T14:19:00.000Z,cary,pfp,roger
2005-06-25T14:19:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"and anything else you'd like to add, heh"
2005-06-25T14:20:00.000Z,cary,pfp,i'd love to add lots of stuff but i havnt a clue what those things are
2005-06-25T14:21:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"same command, yep"
2005-06-25T14:22:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"probably that therm patch is a good idea too, since the author recommends it"
2005-06-25T14:22:00.000Z,cary,pfp,all patches (save the fn key) are done
2005-06-25T14:23:00.000Z,cary,pfp,one step ahead (first time ever!)
2005-06-25T14:27:00.000Z,cary,pfp,now what?
2005-06-25T14:28:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"i was reading some docs on how to make this easy (i know how to compile a kernel 'by hand', but theres a more automated method)"
2005-06-25T14:28:00.000Z,cary,pfp,ahha. sorry to rush. i appreciate your help very much
2005-06-25T14:33:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"ok.... you need to configure the kernel sources before compiling, do: cp /boot/config-`uname -r` .config"
2005-06-25T14:33:00.000Z,pfp,cary,in the linux-2.6... directory
2005-06-25T14:34:00.000Z,pfp,cary,then: make oldconfig
2005-06-25T14:35:00.000Z,pfp,cary,ah... you need some tools
2005-06-25T14:36:00.000Z,pfp,cary,sudo apt-get install build-essential kernel-package fakeroot
2005-06-25T14:39:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"yep, now the previous command"
2005-06-25T14:40:00.000Z,cary,pfp,what is that?
2005-06-25T14:40:00.000Z,cary,pfp,i assume i hit yes...?
2005-06-25T14:40:00.000Z,cary,pfp,ahh..its something about the thermal thin
2005-06-25T14:42:00.000Z,cary,pfp,i sent you the whole thing. i assume its just asking about proccesor stuff. like asking if iw ant to do that
2005-06-25T14:42:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"you can just go w/ the defaults, ie. press enter for everything"
2005-06-25T14:43:00.000Z,cary,pfp,done with that bit
2005-06-25T14:46:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"ok, you should be ready to compile: make-kpkg kernel_image"
2005-06-25T14:46:00.000Z,cary,pfp,from what dir
2005-06-25T14:47:00.000Z,pfp,cary,in the same linux-2.6.xx dir
2005-06-25T14:47:00.000Z,pfp,cary,compiling will take quite a while then
2005-06-25T14:47:00.000Z,cary,pfp,doing it now presumably
2005-06-25T14:48:00.000Z,pfp,cary,it should also print out lots of stuff; don't get scared :)
2005-06-25T14:49:00.000Z,cary,pfp,oh its printing. its printing like the wind blows
2005-06-25T15:02:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"i have to go (i'm moving), but i'll be around later today (or whatever the timezone)"
2005-06-25T15:03:00.000Z,cary,pfp,or is there some place that can show me where to go from here?
2005-06-25T15:03:00.000Z,cary,pfp,and thank you so much.
2005-06-25T15:18:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"heh, still here, though i'm really out in 10min.  ..."
2005-06-25T15:19:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"after it's compiled, you need to 1) install the kernel package 2) make sure your boot loader is ok. i actually forgot that you're on a Mac; that makes any advice on LILO or GRUB useless to you"
2005-06-25T15:19:00.000Z,cary,pfp,and lsuactiafner was saying i have more junks to do after this
2005-06-25T15:21:00.000Z,cary,pfp,good to know its apparently not possible for me to have janekd this up yet
2005-06-25T15:22:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"yep, you need sudo / root to break anything ,)"
2005-06-25T15:24:00.000Z,cary,pfp,"is installing the kernel especially hard, and how do i check my boot loader?"
2005-06-25T15:26:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"actually, heh, i don't remember, it's been a few years since i had linux on a mac (pc differs in this vs. mac vs. other architectures)"
2005-06-25T15:27:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"hopefully i'll have a chance to check that later, now i _really_ have to attend real-life stuff... ->"
2005-06-26T13:56:00.000Z,cary,pfp,you around? haha
2005-06-28T08:48:00.000Z,pfp,cary,hi (i'm finally back on the net)
2005-06-28T08:48:00.000Z,cary,pfp,so..i finally compiled my kernel with those patches and that kernal wont boot
2005-06-28T08:49:00.000Z,pfp,cary,horrible :) took whole weekend
2005-06-28T08:49:00.000Z,cary,pfp,where did you come from and where did you go?
2005-06-28T08:49:00.000Z,pfp,cary,you got it installed though?
2005-06-28T08:51:00.000Z,pfp,cary,i moved about 5km further north inside helsinki.... have to spend a few months at my parent's place because a commune i lived in got a bit sour
2005-06-28T08:52:00.000Z,cary,pfp,yheah i got it installed!
2005-06-28T08:52:00.000Z,pfp,cary,what error does it give then?
2005-06-28T08:52:00.000Z,cary,pfp,ill need to reboot to write it down
2005-06-28T08:53:00.000Z,pfp,cary,a digital foto of the boot stuff maybe?
2005-06-28T08:53:00.000Z,cary,pfp,what kind of commune. lviing in teh southeast usa i dont real;ly get a whole lot of that
2005-06-28T08:54:00.000Z,cary,pfp,sure thing
2005-06-28T08:56:00.000Z,cary,pfp,brb!
2005-06-28T09:04:00.000Z,cary,pfp,you there?
2005-06-28T09:07:00.000Z,pfp,cary,yep
2005-06-28T09:07:00.000Z,cary,pfp,oaky
2005-06-28T09:08:00.000Z,pfp,cary,sure
2005-06-28T09:10:00.000Z,cary,pfp,basically it gets to that point and just sits there
2005-06-28T09:12:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"heh, i dont understand any of that actually :/ the messages are probably all mac-specific"
2005-06-28T09:12:00.000Z,cary,pfp,awesome.
2005-06-28T09:13:00.000Z,cary,pfp,how ic an i go back the the kernel i used to have as my default
2005-06-28T09:13:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"hmm, maybe you could try compiling a kernel without any patches, to see if they cause the error"
2005-06-28T09:14:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"you'd have to check yaboot's configuration (pc's use GRUB instead) or ask someone who knows yaboot, sorry"
2005-06-28T09:15:00.000Z,pfp,cary,maybe  http://www.askdavetaylor.com/tweak_yaboot_so_mac_os_x_is_my_default_os_not_ubuntu_or_yellow_dog_linux.html
2005-06-28T09:16:00.000Z,cary,pfp,thanks!
2005-06-28T09:25:00.000Z,cary,pfp,so how would i restore my old kernel to be the only kernel?
2005-06-28T09:26:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"oh yeah, the commune.. we had like 4 guys, aged 23-26 years; a maths student, an unemployed musician, would-be history student and meself"
2005-06-28T09:26:00.000Z,pfp,cary,did you install it with dpkg -i file.deb ?
2005-06-28T09:27:00.000Z,cary,pfp,whatever the make-???? command is on the howto page
2005-06-28T09:27:00.000Z,pfp,cary,'make-kpgk kernel_image' ?
2005-06-28T09:28:00.000Z,cary,pfp,but commune...does that mean you guys just live in the same area or was there some like...Goal of the commune? some binding tie that caused it to exist?
2005-06-28T09:28:00.000Z,cary,pfp,yes. that
2005-06-28T09:30:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"no not really, just 4 ~friends sharing a flat... turned out the music guy had a habit of flipping out and getting violent if he drunk too much... and being metal fans, they used to do that heh"
2005-06-28T09:31:00.000Z,cary,pfp,word. ye olde metal(e) fans(e)
2005-06-28T09:32:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"make-kpkg kernel_image just builds a kernel package in a file called linux-image_something.deb, usually install that file to your system with like 'dpkg -i linux-image_etcetera.deb'"
2005-06-28T09:33:00.000Z,pfp,cary,i'm more into electro / hiphop / soul meself.. altough i digest almost anything :)
2005-06-28T09:34:00.000Z,pfp,cary,ill have a look at the howto
2005-06-28T09:34:00.000Z,cary,pfp,"what sort of bands/people/djs?  also, you are a good man to accomodate my laziness. (in reality im carrying on two conversations that are non-nerd)"
2005-06-28T09:37:00.000Z,cary,pfp,dpkg -i linux-image-2.6.8.1_custom.1.0_i386.deb
2005-06-28T09:37:00.000Z,cary,pfp,but i changed the name to the .deb that i actually had
2005-06-28T09:38:00.000Z,pfp,cary,ok. did you (have to) tweak anything after that?
2005-06-28T09:38:00.000Z,cary,pfp,no. it all installed as it woudl by default
2005-06-28T09:41:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"can you still boot to ubuntu with the old kernel, or does yaboot only show the nwe one besides os x?"
2005-06-28T09:42:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"stuff like aphex twin, legowelt, 8bit rockers, jazzanova"
2005-06-28T09:42:00.000Z,cary,pfp,cool. do you know nightmares on wax?
2005-06-28T09:42:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"oh yeah, they're great :)"
2005-06-28T09:42:00.000Z,cary,pfp,agreed.
2005-06-28T09:43:00.000Z,cary,pfp,warp has a lot of great stuff on it.
2005-06-28T09:43:00.000Z,cary,pfp,the most main stream thing i have heard and liked lately is john legend. reminds me of old shcool lauren hill
2005-06-28T09:43:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"cool, i have to check that out"
2005-06-28T09:46:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"you should be able to remove the new one with 'dpkg --remove package_name', if everything goes as planned, that automatocally configures yaboot to list your old kernel"
2005-06-28T09:47:00.000Z,pfp,cary,you can find out package_name with 'dpkg --get-selections | grep linux-image'
2005-06-28T09:47:00.000Z,cary,pfp,its got like..normal pop feel to it which i normally dont like a lot but i liked it enough to buy it from itunes.
2005-06-28T09:50:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"hmm, you might want to back up your current yaboot.conf, altough it seems the kernel packages can handle it by themselves"
2005-06-28T09:51:00.000Z,cary,pfp,"yeah, uh how?"
2005-06-28T09:51:00.000Z,pfp,cary,yep
2005-06-28T09:52:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"between removing the kernel and reboting, it would be wise to check that the new yaboot conf is sane"
2005-06-28T09:56:00.000Z,pfp,cary,or just 'cp yaboot.conf yaboot.conf.bak' (if you were talking about backing it up?)
2005-06-28T09:57:00.000Z,cary,pfp,i meant how to check it. oh i see what you mean. yeah. ill do that. i meant to see if it was still okay
2005-06-28T09:57:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"in the terminal, you can view files with 'less filename'"
2005-06-28T09:59:00.000Z,cary,pfp,ahha! so many things i dont know
2005-06-28T10:01:00.000Z,pfp,cary,a world of knowledge awaits... :)
2005-06-28T10:03:00.000Z,pfp,cary,be back soon...
2005-06-28T10:07:00.000Z,cary,pfp,okay
2005-06-28T10:38:00.000Z,cary,pfp,lemme know when youa re back if there is any chance you read this
2005-06-28T10:39:00.000Z,pfp,cary,here
2005-06-28T10:39:00.000Z,cary,pfp,i removed the image
2005-06-28T10:39:00.000Z,cary,pfp,but i dont exactly know what im looking for in yaboot.conf. do you have any idea?
2005-06-28T10:41:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"just that still specifies your old image, correct filename etc"
2005-06-28T10:41:00.000Z,pfp,cary,press q .)
2005-06-28T10:43:00.000Z,pfp,cary,you could check differences between the conf files with 'diff yaboot.conf yaboot.conf.old'
2005-06-28T10:44:00.000Z,pfp,cary,but i recall nalioth saying the conf is most probably ok
2005-06-28T10:45:00.000Z,pfp,cary,q doesn't work? hmm
2005-06-28T10:45:00.000Z,pfp,cary,could you pastebin the conf somewhere?
2005-06-28T10:46:00.000Z,cary,pfp,"btw, whatsure"
2005-06-28T10:46:00.000Z,cary,pfp,sure
2005-06-28T10:48:00.000Z,cary,pfp,http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/150
2005-06-28T10:49:00.000Z,cary,pfp,but why what
2005-06-28T10:50:00.000Z,pfp,cary,just referring to that WIN_ME :)
2005-06-28T10:52:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"hmm, are /boot/vmlinux and /boot/vmlinux.old symlinks to some other files?"
2005-06-28T10:54:00.000Z,cary,pfp,im not realy sure
2005-06-28T10:56:00.000Z,cary,pfp,im not really sure what thye are i guess.
2005-06-28T10:56:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"you can check it with 'ls -l' inside /boot. if the file names have ' -> vmlinux-123.ver.sion', they are symbolic links to those files"
2005-06-28T10:57:00.000Z,pfp,cary,symlinks in unix are about the same as aliases in Mac OS(X)
2005-06-28T10:57:00.000Z,cary,pfp,ahha.
2005-06-28T10:58:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"the idea is that installing a new kernel just changes the symlink, so there is no need to change the file names inside yaboot.conf"
2005-06-28T10:58:00.000Z,cary,pfp,im going to paste the ls -l result
2005-06-28T10:58:00.000Z,pfp,cary,good
2005-06-28T10:59:00.000Z,cary,pfp,done.
2005-06-28T11:04:00.000Z,cary,pfp,make any sense?
2005-06-28T11:04:00.000Z,pfp,cary,yep
2005-06-28T11:04:00.000Z,cary,pfp,so can you translate into noob?
2005-06-28T11:06:00.000Z,cary,pfp,so should i risk a reboot?
2005-06-28T11:06:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"so, yaboot.conf specifies two kernels; /boot/vmlinux and /boot/vmlinux.old, whenever you 'dpkg -i linux-image_blaa.deb', the installer changes those symlinks to point to /boot/vmlinux-blaa.ver.sion"
2005-06-28T11:08:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"it would be safe to add a yaboot.conf section that points directly to vmlinux-2.6.10-5-powerpc (the original kernel), that way you always have a safe fallback"
2005-06-28T11:08:00.000Z,cary,pfp,so that'd be like pasting in a new area of the conf file with a full path to the original kernel
2005-06-28T11:10:00.000Z,pfp,cary,yep... check 153
2005-06-28T11:11:00.000Z,cary,pfp,~^
2005-06-28T11:13:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"yep, it should (ofc you should write your own, but dealing with boot loaders is a bit risky (as if i knew any better))"
2005-06-28T11:19:00.000Z,cary,pfp,no love
2005-06-28T11:19:00.000Z,cary,pfp,do i have to update the bootstrap or anything?
2005-06-28T11:19:00.000Z,pfp,cary,booting to 'original' didn't work?
2005-06-28T11:20:00.000Z,pfp,cary,or was there none offered?
2005-06-28T11:21:00.000Z,cary,pfp,the site you sent me about osx default mentions this: pfp
2005-06-28T11:22:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"ah, yes, didn't realize that"
2005-06-28T11:23:00.000Z,pfp,cary,yep
2005-06-28T11:24:00.000Z,pfp,cary,that 'file not found' probably came because there's no /boot/vmlinux
2005-06-28T11:25:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"hmm don't think so... looking at the picture, the bootloader seemed to load it fine, but then the kernel itself seemed to get trouble"
2005-06-28T11:25:00.000Z,cary,pfp,yeah..that was optimism. hah
2005-06-28T11:27:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"hmm, maybe the command is called something else on ubuntu... anyway, it reads yaboot.conf and prolly some other stuff and writes it to a location on your disk, where yaboot can find it when booting"
2005-06-28T11:27:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"ybin should be an executable file (ie. command), not a directory"
2005-06-28T11:29:00.000Z,pfp,cary, :)
2005-06-28T11:30:00.000Z,pfp,cary,luck
2005-06-28T11:41:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"mmm that's because /boot/vmlinux doesn't exist, it was probably removed when you dpkg --remove'd the custom kernel"
2005-06-28T11:42:00.000Z,cary,pfp,shoudl i put a manual path? im not really sure the boto strap isbeing updated
2005-06-28T11:42:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"so, if you'd like to use the Linux entry for booting linux, you could recreate the symlink"
2005-06-28T11:43:00.000Z,pfp,cary,did you see the 'original' there now?
2005-06-28T11:43:00.000Z,cary,pfp,how do i check my active kernel version again?
2005-06-28T11:43:00.000Z,pfp,cary,uname -r
2005-06-28T11:44:00.000Z,cary,pfp,so...i pasted the contents of my boot dir
2005-06-28T11:46:00.000Z,cary,pfp,one thing im pissed about is i had my hd partitioned to use number 5 (according to the install booter) but it ended up using 6 (ddidnt realzie that for a while)..so lost 10 gigs (whihc was the partition i had set for linux)
2005-06-28T11:48:00.000Z,cary,pfp,so how woudl i recreat the symlink?
2005-06-28T11:49:00.000Z,pfp,cary,ok... (that partition thing might take a while to solve)
2005-06-28T11:49:00.000Z,cary,pfp,yeha. i am counting it lost for now
2005-06-28T11:49:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"cd /boot, then 'ln -s vmlinux-2.6.10-5-powerpc vmlinux'"
2005-06-28T11:52:00.000Z,cary,pfp,brb
2005-06-28T11:54:00.000Z,cary,pfp,well..i am booted into osx
2005-06-28T11:55:00.000Z,pfp,cary,cool
2005-06-28T12:00:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"heh, hmm"
2005-06-28T12:01:00.000Z,pfp,cary,'Linux' probably fails because the initrd= line is commented out there
2005-06-28T12:02:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"original should work though, 'tis strange"
2005-06-28T12:03:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"i guess it would be safe, until something changes the vmlinux.old link to point somewhere else"
2005-06-28T12:09:00.000Z,cary,pfp," guess it worked. i had only the one option, and it boots. took long enough right?"
2005-06-28T12:09:00.000Z,pfp,cary,rite
2005-06-28T12:10:00.000Z,cary,pfp,but my sound still blows
2005-06-28T12:11:00.000Z,pfp,cary,did you try the hoarysondfix thing?
2005-06-28T12:13:00.000Z,pfp,cary,ah
2005-06-28T12:13:00.000Z,pfp,cary,lol
2005-06-28T12:14:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"probably the kernel fix si what you need, since _all_ sound is f'd up"
2005-06-28T12:16:00.000Z,cary,pfp,is ALL linux software open source and free or just most of it?
2005-06-28T12:16:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"eya, you shouldn't have to figh kernels and bootloaders on your ~1st day on linux"
2005-06-28T12:17:00.000Z,pfp,cary,"most, but there's closed source too, like acrobat reader, some games"
2005-06-28T12:17:00.000Z,pfp,cary,i has to go to work...
2005-06-28T12:18:00.000Z,pfp,cary,PM me if something comes up
