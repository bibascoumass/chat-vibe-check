2005-02-16T10:30:00.000Z,crimsun,,"to be fair, alsa can't do hardware mixing, only hardware can. alsa is software."
2005-02-16T10:30:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i finally gave up on dmix... my boards seems to do hardware mixing :)
2005-02-16T10:31:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,...not sure why you were messing with dmix in the first place!
2005-02-16T10:31:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"well, i didn't know that it did till i was messing around with it"
2005-02-16T10:31:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,and 1.0.8 didn't help dmix any
2005-02-16T10:31:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,your symptoms are interesting; I'll have to look into it.
2005-02-16T10:32:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"well, i might even say it was working, but if so the volume was 0... no way to tell with no sound :)"
2005-02-16T12:26:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,what did you use before ubuntu?
2005-02-16T12:27:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"I still use Debian. In fact, my main machine is Sid+experimental+Hoary with enough chroots and pbuilders to drive one batty."
2005-02-16T12:28:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,pbuilder?
2005-02-16T12:28:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,apt-cache show pbuilder :-)
2005-02-16T12:40:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"yeah, i should just google if my interenet weren't so darn slow"
2005-02-16T12:30:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"interesting, so it's kinda like debootstrap?"
2005-02-16T12:30:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,except intender only for chroots?
2005-02-16T12:31:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"it essentially automates that ordeal, yes"
2005-02-16T12:32:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,very effective and highly recommended if you want to build packages
2005-02-16T12:32:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,are you saying al ot of pacages are pulled out and then exclusively maintained by ubuntu?
2005-02-16T12:32:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"hmmm, sid frozen?"
2005-02-16T12:33:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,only packages that are necessary and maintainable are moved from universe to main
2005-02-16T12:34:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,so... gnome is main?
2005-02-16T12:34:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"yes, since it's the base of Ubuntu"
2005-02-16T12:34:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,is ubunut compiled with different cflags than base debian?
2005-02-16T12:37:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,do you know the difference in cflags?
2005-02-16T12:37:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"err...there's a linker tweak iirc, but no major CFLAGS tweaking that I know of"
2005-02-16T12:38:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,so they're all 386 compiled like debian?
2005-02-16T12:38:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i swore i read something on that somewhere
2005-02-16T12:39:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"you'll need to dig deeper, because I don't know offhand. They may be optimised for 586+."
2005-02-16T13:29:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,is there anywhere to rsync the CDs from the net?
2005-02-16T13:29:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,that would work :)
2005-02-18T11:25:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,should i just use my debian grub to boot ubuntu or let it install grub on the boot sector of the partition i give it?
2005-02-18T11:26:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"either, though you shouldn't have to install grub a second time."
2005-02-18T11:27:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,so you so install no boot loader and modify my debian bootloader to do it... ?
2005-02-18T11:27:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"debian is permanent, ubuntu is on trial (for now)"
2005-02-18T11:28:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"makes sense to add the entry into your permanent bootloader's config, no?"
2005-02-18T11:29:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,ok :)
2005-02-18T11:34:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"i can boot ubuntu and chroot into debian, no? :)"
2005-02-18T11:34:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"even with the install cd, no?"
2005-02-18T11:34:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,haven't tried with the install cd
2005-02-19T11:16:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,it sure does.
2005-02-19T11:16:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,not working for the life of me
2005-02-19T11:16:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,did you follow the instructions for 'gstreamer0.8-mad' on /wiki/RestrictedFormats ?
2005-02-19T11:16:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"ok, that's it :)"
2005-02-19T11:17:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"thanks, coming down now :)"
2005-02-19T12:06:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,that's someone elses problem :)
2005-02-19T12:07:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"encryption is not the end-all solution, as bruce schneier finally paraphrased."
2005-02-22T11:32:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,working on that.
2005-02-22T11:32:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,working on it as in?
2005-02-22T11:32:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"this weekend, I'll have a wiki page up, and hopefully people will drop by and provide input."
2005-02-22T11:32:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,as in there were at least 4 interested parties in pushing XFce 4.2 into Ubuntu-able shape.
2005-02-22T11:33:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,maybe i could just build .debs and save everyone some trouble :)
2005-02-22T11:33:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,building debs isn't the issue; there's plenty of infrastructure. :) It's the streamlining and cohesive fit with the remainder of Ubuntu that needs to be polished.
2005-02-22T11:34:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,building .debs is my issue right now :)
2005-02-22T11:36:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"i'm scared, xfce wants to pull in SOOO much stuff"
2005-02-22T11:36:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,expected.
2005-02-22T11:36:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,guess when i installed on debian i alreayd had most of this :)
2005-02-22T11:38:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"its footprint tends to be more slight, but it certainly has its share of infrastructure."
2005-02-22T11:40:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"is there anything smaller, yet sexier?"
2005-02-22T11:41:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"to be honest, my current hoary machine is kaput, so I can't recommend anything offhand. I've used blackbox, openbox, fluxbox, larswm, ratpoison, oroborox, etc., etc., and 'smaller, yet sexier' is simply subjective."
2005-02-22T11:42:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,true :) i was _really_ liking xfce under debian... i've even modified my gnome panels to be more 'xfceish'
2005-02-22T11:47:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,how will i know when you get the wiki up? :)
2005-02-22T11:47:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,I will post to u-u about it.
2005-02-22T11:47:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i guess work on xfce would really be for hoary?
2005-02-22T11:47:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,u-u?
2005-02-22T11:47:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,Hoary+1; it's a bit late for Hoary.
2005-02-22T11:48:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,ubuntu-user
2005-02-22T11:52:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"so, what are the biggest things to making xfce ubuntable?"
2005-02-22T11:52:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,ottoyh
2005-02-22T11:52:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,and i'm not going to sign up for a list with 200m/day :)
2005-02-22T11:52:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i guess i'll just hear about it eventually
2005-02-23T17:37:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"hey, is the xfce page up yet?"
2005-02-28T11:16:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,how is the xfce wiki going?
2005-02-28T11:16:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,testing packages
2005-02-28T11:17:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,huh? is there a url?
2005-02-28T11:17:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"for the wiki page? no, not yet."
2005-02-28T11:35:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"sorry, not an evo user."
2005-02-28T11:47:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"man, lsmod, alsamixer, strace, sudo, ..."
2005-02-28T12:12:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,you still planning on putting up a wiki?
2005-02-28T12:12:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,of course.
2005-02-28T12:13:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,gnome will get old eventually :)
2005-02-28T12:13:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"I'm not claiming sole rights to it, so if you feel like putting one up, go ahead. Please let me know the url, however."
2005-02-28T12:13:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"i wouldn't even know what to put, since i'm not involved yet :)"
2005-02-28T12:17:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,what is this polypaudio thing?
2005-02-28T12:18:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,drop-in replacement for EsounD
2005-02-28T12:19:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,hmmm... and i'd want it because? :)
2005-02-28T12:19:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"don't worry, you don't HAVE to have it. Granted, you won't have much choice when you dist-upgrade."
2005-02-28T12:19:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,ah
2005-02-28T12:19:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,interesting :)
2005-02-28T12:23:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,are you running hoary?
2005-02-28T12:23:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"personally? no, sid+experimental+hoary"
2005-02-28T12:24:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"wow, you like to live on the edge :)"
2005-02-28T12:24:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,I've been with sid for many years.
2005-02-28T12:24:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"ah, i see"
2005-02-28T12:24:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"i was with Debian for quite a while, but I left ;-)"
2005-02-28T12:25:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,more stable (but less so than 'stable') packages are a plus when you're on dial-up
2005-02-28T12:25:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,certainly
2005-02-28T12:25:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"i added backports right away and upgraded a few apps, but i'm happy with warty for the most part ..."
2005-02-28T12:29:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,you said you'd been working on the xfce thing thoguh?
2005-02-28T12:29:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,yes
2005-02-28T12:29:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,what thing were necessary to 'unbutuize' the packages?
2005-02-28T12:31:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"menus, session configs, rox-filer integration, and some things we haven't completed yet: ubuntu themes, among others"
2005-02-28T12:32:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"ah, theme's should be too hard, should they? :)"
2005-03-23T15:36:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"bored, eh? Want fun & excitement(TM)?"
2005-03-23T15:36:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i dunno :)
2005-04-08T09:44:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,dsl?
2005-04-08T09:45:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,?
2005-04-08T09:45:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,I have a 32 MB machine that crunches along with Ubuntu
2005-04-08T09:45:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,it runs blackbox
2005-04-08T09:45:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,ah...
2005-04-08T09:45:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,good thought
2005-04-08T12:02:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"ok, what's wrong with backports?"
2005-04-08T12:02:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i have gaim+gtk2.6+firefox only :)
2005-04-08T12:02:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"well, maybe a few other small packages that looked nice, but not much"
2005-04-08T12:02:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,some are quite poorly versioned and will cause dist-upgrade ditches
2005-04-08T12:02:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,suppose it's talked about on the forum somewheres?
2005-04-08T12:03:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,uninstallation instructions?
2005-04-08T12:03:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"your best bet is to uninstall all backports prior to dist-upgrading on 6 abril, 2005"
2005-04-08T12:05:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"are the new ubp versions safe, or you don't know?"
2005-04-08T12:05:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,ubp?
2005-04-08T12:06:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,they changed how backports were versioned to try and solve these problems at one time i believe
2005-04-08T12:07:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"I don't follow ubp, so unfortunately I can't comment.  I do know that as a universe maintainer, it is extremely difficult to track all the different external repos and have their packages interoperate smoothly with ubuntu's."
2005-04-11T14:27:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,*laughs*
2005-04-11T14:27:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,you know anything about X.org?
2005-04-11T14:28:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"i upgraded to Hoary and it all works, but X doesn't un-initialize or something on shutdown and my display just says 'bad signal' (you know the error) i have to hit ctrl-alt-del (And the system shutsdown normall)..."
2005-04-11T14:28:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,any ideas?
2005-04-11T14:29:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"oh, and would you know how to tell debian to generate a new xorg.conf?  it's using my old one (i had a custom x.org with warty)... and it didn't touch it... so i'd like to see what it's sane default would be"
2005-04-11T14:29:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"need more diagnostic info, like /var/log/Xorg.0.log and /etc/X11/xorg.conf in addition to lspci -v, lsmod, and dmesg output"
2005-04-11T14:30:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,yikes :)
2005-04-11T14:30:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i'll see if this latest xorg update fixes it first
2005-04-11T14:31:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,oh?
2005-04-11T14:31:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,so i should expect it to not fix it?
2005-04-11T14:31:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"no, unless it's dependent on migrating your earlier XF86Config-4/xorg.conf"
2005-04-11T14:32:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,xserver-xorg postinst warning: not updating /etc/X11/xorg.conf; file has
2005-04-11T14:32:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,if i remove it will reinstalling xserver-xorg give me a new file i wonder...
2005-04-11T14:34:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"ah, no i have a default again... so i'll try with that"
2005-04-11T14:44:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"how do i get all that to you? (i'm not a total newbie here, fyi... X.org.log the only real error is the synaptics driver - which i don't have)"
2005-04-11T14:44:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i'm still seeing if the newer kernel might somehow fix it
2005-04-11T14:44:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,pastebin.com
2005-04-11T14:50:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,what info do you need again?
2005-04-11T14:52:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,?
2005-04-11T14:52:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"i got Xorg.log, xorg.conf, and lspci ready... did you mention something else?  sorry, in and out of X/irssi/etc, can't scroll up to look"

2005-04-11T14:54:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,are they all supposed to fit in one?
2005-04-11T14:54:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i just posted a bunch and it's all coming back blank?
2005-04-11T14:54:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"ah, there we do"

2005-04-11T15:01:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,will get to it shortly :)
2005-04-11T15:01:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"thanks, really appreciate it"

2005-04-11T15:22:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"well, 'startx', but yes"
2005-04-11T15:23:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,then try and quit again and see if it's fixed?
2005-04-11T15:23:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"however you could reproduce it before, yes"
2005-04-11T15:24:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,brb then
2005-04-11T15:49:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,no dice

2005-04-11T15:50:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,and from X i can ctrl-alt-f1 easily enough...
2005-04-11T15:51:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"and while X Window System is running, switching to the terminal on tty1 (ctrl+alt+F1) gives you a working console?"
2005-04-11T15:51:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"yes, while X is running i can switch back and forth easily"
2005-04-11T15:55:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,next suggestion?
2005-04-11T15:56:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"at least now i can test without rebooting... (mess it up, restart x, console, kill x, restart x.....)"
2005-04-11T16:01:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,UseBios 'true' didn't help...
2005-04-11T16:02:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"oh, never mind, it's on by default"
2005-04-11T16:02:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"hum, I would have asked you to turn it off/use 'false'"
2005-04-11T16:03:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,want me to try that? :)
2005-04-11T16:03:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i'm also thinking of powering down the laptop completely (can't think if i've done that since i was using DRI before)
2005-04-11T16:03:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"false it is, brb"
2005-04-11T16:10:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"ok, set it to false... first time had some static on the screen when moving things, but it seems to be working just spiffy now"
2005-04-11T16:11:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,thanks for your help!
2005-04-11T16:11:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"in the next few days i'll be getting DRI working on here again, so that should be fun :)"
2005-04-11T16:12:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,fun
2005-04-11T16:14:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,*shrugs* glad i only see it once every 60 days or so :)
2005-04-12T05:24:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,where are thos xfce packages? :)
2005-04-14T07:09:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,make sure you're running the latest Hoary kernel
2005-04-14T07:10:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,were there known problems with one a few days ago?
2005-04-14T07:11:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"if one is very, very savvy with kernel exploits, possibly"
2005-04-14T07:11:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"in most situations, however, it's a userspace application that's not freeing/deleting dynamically allocated memory properly"
2005-04-14T07:11:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,ah... i will reboot here in a sec (i noticed the kernel upgrade a day or two ago)...
2005-04-14T07:12:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i didn't know apps could do that... there isn't OS cleanup or something?
2005-04-14T07:12:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"if only, heh."
2005-04-14T07:13:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"well, how would one go about tracking which program it is?"
2005-04-14T07:13:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"there are a number of C library options; on a per-application basis, try running with valgrind"
2005-04-14T07:13:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,that quickly moves into development territory
2005-04-14T07:14:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"ah, i see"
2005-04-14T08:15:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,how are you using pidof?
2005-04-14T08:15:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,pidof name
2005-04-14T08:16:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,that returns pids
2005-04-14T08:16:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"except in this case it doesn't return anything, which is my problem"
2005-04-14T08:16:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,use pgrep instead
2005-04-14T08:16:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"i would blame it on the fact that it's a bash script, but killall seems to know what to do with it"
2005-04-14T08:17:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,thanks!
2005-04-14T08:17:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,np
2005-04-14T08:21:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,use a pid file or a stamp file in a secure fashion.
2005-04-14T08:23:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"ah, just compairing against $$ works"
2005-04-15T15:23:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,you around?
2005-04-15T15:24:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,yes?
2005-04-15T15:25:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"i have a via82xx chipset and the audio driver is blocking gnome from starting... same effect on hoary as warty, so the new kernel didn't help"
2005-04-15T15:25:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"removing the snd_82xx (not sure exactly name) or killing esd repeatedly allows gnome to start, any ideas?"
2005-04-15T15:27:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,I'm not sure what you're saying; is snd_via82xx actually hanging the system?
2005-04-15T15:28:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"the system isn't hanging, but gnome either displays a brown background (warty) or doesn't even get that far (hoary)... it just sets there... i didn't give it more than 2-3 minutes... rmmoding the sound driver... or killing esd a few times will 'jumpstart' things"
2005-04-15T15:28:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"obviously these are permanent solutions, so i was hoping yuo'd have suggestions"
2005-04-15T15:29:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"ok, first thing to test is whether gnome starts successfully with the setting 'Enable sound server startup' _UN_checked"
2005-04-15T15:29:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"ok :) i think that'll prove me point, but hold on :)"
2005-04-15T15:30:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,brb
2005-04-15T15:31:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,starts flawlessly without a sound daemon
2005-04-15T15:31:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"ie, unchecked"
2005-04-15T15:33:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"i guess the next thing would be to see if sound works from the console via alsa, or no/"
2005-04-15T15:33:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,yes
2005-04-15T15:34:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"well, darn i have no speakers..."
2005-04-15T15:35:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"and is it works from console, bug against esd, if not i might just be stuck?"
2005-04-15T15:35:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,no headphones here either :)
2005-04-15T15:35:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,does hoary have the latest alsa?
2005-04-15T15:35:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"not necessarily an esd bug, since if you start esd from the terminal and use an esd app, and it works, then that shoots that theory"
2005-04-15T15:36:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"ok, so basically get speakers and play around?"
2005-04-15T15:36:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"no, Hoary's kernel contains 1.0.6, which is ~2 revisions older than the latest."
2005-04-15T15:36:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,how hard is it to get the latest?
2005-04-15T15:36:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"fortunately, 'alsa-source' is 1.0.8, which is currently the newest."
2005-04-15T15:37:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i'm apt-getting alsa-source now
2005-04-15T15:37:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"i think upgraded to the latest will be quickest... then if no problem, i'll assume it's fixed"
2005-04-15T15:37:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,you'll also need 'linux-headers-$(uname -r)' and 'build-essential'
2005-04-15T15:38:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,(1.0.9 is right around the corner)
2005-04-15T15:38:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,good notes
2005-04-15T15:38:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,ah
2005-04-15T15:38:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"well, this is a GREAT PC, but without sound it's gonna kinda suck"
2005-04-15T15:38:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"wait, once hoary freezes 1.0.9 will be harder to get, no?"
2005-04-15T15:40:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"ok, i don't REALLY need build-essential (which includes g++) i just need MOST of it, right? :)"
2005-04-15T15:40:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"you need build-essential, linux-headers-$(uname -r), and alsa-source"
2005-04-15T15:41:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,ok ok :)
2005-04-15T15:46:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,have you had lots of people that needed to upgrade to get their sound working?
2005-04-15T15:47:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,or anyone?
2005-04-15T15:47:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"quite a few, but they are hardly the norm"
2005-04-15T15:47:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,ah...
2005-04-15T15:47:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"many, many more have simply dist-upgraded flawlessly"
2005-04-15T15:47:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,any with this hardware?
2005-04-15T15:47:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"iirc, yes"
2005-04-15T15:47:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"well, like i said warty never worked either on this box :)"
2005-04-15T15:47:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,same issue
2005-04-15T15:50:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,downloading
2005-04-15T15:52:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,are their instructions anywhere for nvidia with ubuntu? (i'm sure there are)
2005-04-15T15:52:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto
2005-04-15T15:53:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,should i follow the wiki over the guide?
2005-04-15T15:53:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,reconcile both :)
2005-04-15T15:53:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"ok :) this sytem is already so fast though, i can hardly imagine it getting faster"
2005-04-15T15:54:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,guess that's what i get for using a slow 900 laptop all this time :)
2005-04-15T15:55:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"sure, TNT-based"
2005-04-15T15:55:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"though if you don't need hardware 3D acceleration, 'nv' will suffice."
2005-04-15T15:55:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i want the cool screensavers :-)
2005-04-15T15:56:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,this will be a dual-head monster when i'm done with it
2005-04-16T05:25:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,hey!
2005-04-16T05:25:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i still don't know if sound works (no speakers) but alsa 1.0.8 from source fixed gnome starting problem :)
2005-04-16T05:25:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,thanks :)
2005-04-16T05:26:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,thanks again!
2005-04-16T10:02:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"i just switched to binary, and again i can tell things are popping up faster and DRI is enables (glxinfo) but still slow glxgears"
2005-04-16T07:55:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"different video card, different system, simliar problem... but i can't even get console with VT-switching..."
2005-04-16T08:00:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,is that an apt-way to get older nvidia-glx releases?
2005-04-16T08:00:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,'easy' - not really
2005-04-16T08:00:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,'doable' - yes
2005-04-16T08:00:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,try 1.0-7174
2005-04-16T08:00:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,you have any idea what might be up with my new setup?
2005-04-16T08:01:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"yeah, i'm headed to 7174 now"
2005-04-16T08:01:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,there seem to be issues with amd64
2005-04-16T08:01:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"I can't vouch for them, though, since I have no amd64"
2005-04-16T08:01:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i might just have to give up nvidia dreams... i remember (on gentoo) years ago the drivers never worked exactly right...
2005-04-16T08:01:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,k7 here
2005-04-16T08:02:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,what motherboard?
2005-04-16T08:02:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,biostar
2005-04-16T08:04:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,which chipset?
2005-04-16T08:04:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"oh, btw, thanks... recompiling alsa fixed that glitch :)"
2005-04-16T08:04:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,via8233
2005-04-16T08:04:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"i blacklisted via_agp so nvidia's agp stuff could work, but the problem occurs either way"
2005-04-16T08:04:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,those via8233s are a _world_ of trouble with athlons.
2005-04-16T08:04:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,I know from firsthand experience.
2005-04-16T08:04:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,try booting with noapic
2005-04-16T08:04:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,how so?
2005-04-16T08:05:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,my usb subsystem kept crashing until i flashed the bios :)
2005-04-16T08:06:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"so that's a good thing, i should just add it to my boot.lst?"
2005-04-16T08:06:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,or test it first?
2005-04-16T08:06:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,test it first
2005-04-16T08:06:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"i got this system (AXP 1800, 512mb, 20+40gig, etc) from my uncle for $25, i didn't pay too much, did I? :)"
2005-04-16T08:07:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,some hardware is not worth the hassle regardless the cost
2005-04-16T08:07:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,please don't tell me that's what i have
2005-04-16T08:07:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,because it seems QUIET speedy and solid outside of the nvidia issues
2005-04-16T08:08:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"and i'm only running of fthe 20go (20mb/s) drive, the 40g is double fast"
2005-04-16T08:10:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,nope
2005-04-16T08:11:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"so, the system isn't THAT terrible, is it? :)"
2005-04-16T08:11:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,it can be. Mine was awful.
2005-04-16T08:11:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,oh :(
2005-04-16T08:11:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,reliability or just incompatibility?
2005-04-16T08:12:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,reliability
2005-04-16T08:12:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,how long ago was this
2005-04-16T08:12:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,because my 2001 bios sure seemed crappy...
2005-04-16T08:12:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,I'm still using the same system with noapic
2005-04-16T08:12:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,2002 is behaving better
2005-04-16T08:12:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,ah :)
2005-04-16T08:12:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,you have nvidia?
2005-04-16T08:13:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,yup
2005-04-16T08:13:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,but never seem the issue i'm having with screens?
2005-04-16T08:13:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,I saw it constantly in newer kernels unless I used noapic
2005-04-16T08:14:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"well, then... i upgrade to the latest driver, and if that doesn't fix it i try nopaic :)"
2005-04-16T08:19:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,what does noapic actually do?
2005-04-16T08:22:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,disables one of the APIC controllers on your motherboard
2005-04-16T10:02:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i still can't get to a console... and noapic didn't seem to do anything
2005-04-16T10:02:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,kernel still said apic was found and enabled
2005-04-17T08:44:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"noapic didn't have any effect, do you suggest trying nolapic and combos of each?"
2005-04-17T08:47:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,what about pci=noacpi?
2005-04-17T08:47:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"ok, i'll try that"
2005-04-17T09:49:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,and then
2005-04-17T09:51:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,next step?
2005-04-17T09:52:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"in fact i'd take a list, i'm just plugging away"
2005-04-17T09:52:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"sorry, I'm kinda busy atm"
2005-04-20T10:32:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,you can't search the dumb nv forums without registering
2005-04-20T10:32:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,so register
2005-04-20T10:33:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"i did, but i haven't got an e-mai lfrom them"
2005-04-20T10:33:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i'd never make an otherwise public form and require an account just to search :(
2005-04-20T10:33:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,why can't the world just all share my sensabilities? :)
2005-04-20T10:46:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,can i totally stop vesafb from loading?
2005-04-20T10:46:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i think it might be interferring witht my video
2005-04-20T10:46:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,blacklist it
2005-04-20T10:46:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,in /etc/hotplug/blacklist?
2005-04-20T10:46:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,echo vesafb | sudo tee -a /etc/hotplug/blacklist
2005-04-20T10:47:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,vesafb
2005-04-20T10:47:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"those lines are in there, with no effect"
2005-04-20T10:47:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i reboot and it's still there
2005-04-20T10:49:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,any other suggestions?
2005-04-20T10:49:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"via_agp in there works (ie, it doesn't load) but vesafb in the blacklist seems to have no effect"
2005-04-20T10:50:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,would i need to include like cfbimbblt (and things that depend on vesafb) as well?
2005-04-20T10:51:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i'm tempted to just go move the modules
2005-04-20T10:51:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,that's a last-ditch
2005-04-20T10:51:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"well, havint them in blacklist has 0 effect"
2005-04-20T10:53:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,maybe it's not started by hotplug?
2005-04-20T10:54:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,not sure regarding your issue(s)
2005-04-20T10:54:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i will move the modules :) not like i use them... if upgrading to hoary release doesn't magically resovle it that is
2005-04-20T11:00:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,do you know anyone else who's put vesafb there and it's prevented it from loading?
2005-04-20T11:00:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,me.
2005-04-20T11:00:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,oh
2005-04-20T11:01:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,hmmmm
2005-04-20T11:01:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,hmmmmmm
2005-04-20T11:02:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"the lines don't have to be in any order, right?"
2005-04-20T11:02:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,not that I'm aware of. I just used vesafb.
2005-04-20T11:11:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,did you have to put fbcon or anything else in your blacklist for it to work?
2005-04-20T11:11:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,no
2005-04-20T11:11:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,ok
2005-04-20T11:14:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,is software raid0 really any good?
2005-04-20T11:45:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"anyway to find out at what part of the boot vesafb is even loaded, or why?"
2005-04-20T12:42:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,near as i can determine i have to remaster the ubuntu initrd to stop vesafb from being loaded
2005-04-20T12:58:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"one remastered initrd later, nope, not vesafb :) though i have NO idea how you turn yorus off, since it's modprobed in the initrd"
2005-04-20T08:20:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"no, recompiling nvidia.ko won't affect it."
2005-04-20T08:21:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,have you tried simply specifying on boot (the kernel command line) to use regular vga?
2005-04-20T13:13:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,should nvidia _require_ that agpgart be loaded?
2005-04-20T13:13:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,it doesn't.
2005-04-20T13:13:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i can't modprobe it on mine without it without missing symbol errors :-/
2005-04-20T13:13:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,so i'm unique?
2005-04-20T13:15:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i'm thinking maybe they are conflicting (althoguh in X it seems to work find and /proc says it's using nvidia's AGP)... but i'm thinking of anything and everything
2005-04-20T13:18:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i'm building nvidia from source
2005-04-20T13:19:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,nvidia: Unknown symbol agp_bind_memory
2005-04-20T13:20:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i just like 10 or these errors trying to insert it without agpgart loaded
2005-04-20T15:09:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,fixed it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
2005-04-20T15:10:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"well, sorta... evidentally when i boot both video ports (i have a dual-out card) are mirrored... but after X is started and returns to console the console is only on right port (i was using the left)... i guess it should bother me that it isn't both (since I imagine with nv it's both) but now i can switch to console... and i'll prolly be happy until i switch to two monitors and see if that causes new problems :)"
2005-04-29T09:55:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i got thru 3 tests aok... i don't have time to do that now obviously... i booted into 2.6.8.1... we'll see how it goes
2005-05-29T11:06:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,-rwsr-xr--  1 root plugdev 17016 2005-04-04 12:38 /usr/bin/pumount
2005-05-29T11:08:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,thanks ;-)
2005-06-04T10:06:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,don't guess anyone else started reporting memory leaks?
2005-06-04T10:06:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,nafaik
2005-08-23T13:38:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,that's because nautilus is actually covering up Xfce's
2005-08-23T13:38:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,but i killed it
2005-08-23T13:38:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,did you clear ~/.cache too?
2005-08-23T13:39:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"next time, pass --no-desktop to nautilus"
2005-08-23T13:39:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,yeah :) so i can't get my desktop back now without restarting X?
2005-08-23T13:40:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,you did or didn't remove ~/.cache?
2005-08-23T13:40:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"interesting, what is .cache?"
2005-08-23T13:41:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,it's Xfce's cache dir
2005-08-23T13:41:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"ok, i removed it"
2005-08-23T13:41:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"restarting Xfce should suffice, then"
2005-08-23T13:42:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,man
2005-08-23T13:42:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"essentially, yes"
2005-08-23T13:43:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"well, there is a way to remove it :)"
2005-02-16T10:30:00.000Z,crimsun,,"to be fair, alsa can't do hardware mixing, only hardware can. alsa is software."
2005-02-16T10:30:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i finally gave up on dmix... my boards seems to do hardware mixing :)
2005-02-16T10:31:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,...not sure why you were messing with dmix in the first place!
2005-02-16T10:31:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"well, i didn't know that it did till i was messing around with it"
2005-02-16T10:31:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,and 1.0.8 didn't help dmix any
2005-02-16T10:31:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,your symptoms are interesting; I'll have to look into it.
2005-02-16T10:32:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"well, i might even say it was working, but if so the volume was 0... no way to tell with no sound :)"
2005-02-16T12:26:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,what did you use before ubuntu?
2005-02-16T12:27:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"I still use Debian. In fact, my main machine is Sid+experimental+Hoary with enough chroots and pbuilders to drive one batty."
2005-02-16T12:28:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,pbuilder?
2005-02-16T12:28:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,apt-cache show pbuilder :-)
2005-02-16T12:40:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"yeah, i should just google if my interenet weren't so darn slow"
2005-02-16T12:30:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"interesting, so it's kinda like debootstrap?"
2005-02-16T12:30:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,except intender only for chroots?
2005-02-16T12:31:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"it essentially automates that ordeal, yes"
2005-02-16T12:32:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,very effective and highly recommended if you want to build packages
2005-02-16T12:32:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,are you saying al ot of pacages are pulled out and then exclusively maintained by ubuntu?
2005-02-16T12:32:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"hmmm, sid frozen?"
2005-02-16T12:33:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,only packages that are necessary and maintainable are moved from universe to main
2005-02-16T12:34:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,so... gnome is main?
2005-02-16T12:34:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"yes, since it's the base of Ubuntu"
2005-02-16T12:34:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,is ubunut compiled with different cflags than base debian?
2005-02-16T12:37:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,do you know the difference in cflags?
2005-02-16T12:37:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"err...there's a linker tweak iirc, but no major CFLAGS tweaking that I know of"
2005-02-16T12:38:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,so they're all 386 compiled like debian?
2005-02-16T12:38:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i swore i read something on that somewhere
2005-02-16T12:39:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"you'll need to dig deeper, because I don't know offhand. They may be optimised for 586+."
2005-02-16T13:29:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,is there anywhere to rsync the CDs from the net?
2005-02-16T13:29:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,that would work :)
2005-02-18T11:25:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,should i just use my debian grub to boot ubuntu or let it install grub on the boot sector of the partition i give it?
2005-02-18T11:26:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"either, though you shouldn't have to install grub a second time."
2005-02-18T11:27:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,so you so install no boot loader and modify my debian bootloader to do it... ?
2005-02-18T11:27:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"debian is permanent, ubuntu is on trial (for now)"
2005-02-18T11:28:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"makes sense to add the entry into your permanent bootloader's config, no?"
2005-02-18T11:29:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,ok :)
2005-02-18T11:34:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"i can boot ubuntu and chroot into debian, no? :)"
2005-02-18T11:34:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"even with the install cd, no?"
2005-02-18T11:34:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,haven't tried with the install cd
2005-02-19T11:16:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,it sure does.
2005-02-19T11:16:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,not working for the life of me
2005-02-19T11:16:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,did you follow the instructions for 'gstreamer0.8-mad' on /wiki/RestrictedFormats ?
2005-02-19T11:16:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"ok, that's it :)"
2005-02-19T11:17:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"thanks, coming down now :)"
2005-02-19T12:06:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,that's someone elses problem :)
2005-02-19T12:07:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"encryption is not the end-all solution, as bruce schneier finally paraphrased."
2005-02-22T11:32:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,working on that.
2005-02-22T11:32:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,working on it as in?
2005-02-22T11:32:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"this weekend, I'll have a wiki page up, and hopefully people will drop by and provide input."
2005-02-22T11:32:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,as in there were at least 4 interested parties in pushing XFce 4.2 into Ubuntu-able shape.
2005-02-22T11:33:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,maybe i could just build .debs and save everyone some trouble :)
2005-02-22T11:33:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,building debs isn't the issue; there's plenty of infrastructure. :) It's the streamlining and cohesive fit with the remainder of Ubuntu that needs to be polished.
2005-02-22T11:34:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,building .debs is my issue right now :)
2005-02-22T11:36:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"i'm scared, xfce wants to pull in SOOO much stuff"
2005-02-22T11:36:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,expected.
2005-02-22T11:36:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,guess when i installed on debian i alreayd had most of this :)
2005-02-22T11:38:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"its footprint tends to be more slight, but it certainly has its share of infrastructure."
2005-02-22T11:40:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"is there anything smaller, yet sexier?"
2005-02-22T11:41:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"to be honest, my current hoary machine is kaput, so I can't recommend anything offhand. I've used blackbox, openbox, fluxbox, larswm, ratpoison, oroborox, etc., etc., and 'smaller, yet sexier' is simply subjective."
2005-02-22T11:42:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,true :) i was _really_ liking xfce under debian... i've even modified my gnome panels to be more 'xfceish'
2005-02-22T11:47:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,how will i know when you get the wiki up? :)
2005-02-22T11:47:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,I will post to u-u about it.
2005-02-22T11:47:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i guess work on xfce would really be for hoary?
2005-02-22T11:47:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,u-u?
2005-02-22T11:47:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,Hoary+1; it's a bit late for Hoary.
2005-02-22T11:48:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,ubuntu-user
2005-02-22T11:52:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"so, what are the biggest things to making xfce ubuntable?"
2005-02-22T11:52:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,ottoyh
2005-02-22T11:52:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,and i'm not going to sign up for a list with 200m/day :)
2005-02-22T11:52:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i guess i'll just hear about it eventually
2005-02-23T17:37:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"hey, is the xfce page up yet?"
2005-02-28T11:16:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,how is the xfce wiki going?
2005-02-28T11:16:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,testing packages
2005-02-28T11:17:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,huh? is there a url?
2005-02-28T11:17:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"for the wiki page? no, not yet."
2005-02-28T11:35:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"sorry, not an evo user."
2005-02-28T11:47:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"man, lsmod, alsamixer, strace, sudo, ..."
2005-02-28T12:12:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,you still planning on putting up a wiki?
2005-02-28T12:12:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,of course.
2005-02-28T12:13:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,gnome will get old eventually :)
2005-02-28T12:13:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"I'm not claiming sole rights to it, so if you feel like putting one up, go ahead. Please let me know the url, however."
2005-02-28T12:13:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"i wouldn't even know what to put, since i'm not involved yet :)"
2005-02-28T12:17:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,what is this polypaudio thing?
2005-02-28T12:18:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,drop-in replacement for EsounD
2005-02-28T12:19:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,hmmm... and i'd want it because? :)
2005-02-28T12:19:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"don't worry, you don't HAVE to have it. Granted, you won't have much choice when you dist-upgrade."
2005-02-28T12:19:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,ah
2005-02-28T12:19:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,interesting :)
2005-02-28T12:23:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,are you running hoary?
2005-02-28T12:23:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"personally? no, sid+experimental+hoary"
2005-02-28T12:24:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"wow, you like to live on the edge :)"
2005-02-28T12:24:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,I've been with sid for many years.
2005-02-28T12:24:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"ah, i see"
2005-02-28T12:24:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"i was with Debian for quite a while, but I left ;-)"
2005-02-28T12:25:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,more stable (but less so than 'stable') packages are a plus when you're on dial-up
2005-02-28T12:25:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,certainly
2005-02-28T12:25:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"i added backports right away and upgraded a few apps, but i'm happy with warty for the most part ..."
2005-02-28T12:29:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,you said you'd been working on the xfce thing thoguh?
2005-02-28T12:29:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,yes
2005-02-28T12:29:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,what thing were necessary to 'unbutuize' the packages?
2005-02-28T12:31:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"menus, session configs, rox-filer integration, and some things we haven't completed yet: ubuntu themes, among others"
2005-02-28T12:32:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"ah, theme's should be too hard, should they? :)"
2005-03-23T15:36:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"bored, eh? Want fun & excitement(TM)?"
2005-03-23T15:36:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i dunno :)
2005-04-08T09:44:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,dsl?
2005-04-08T09:45:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,?
2005-04-08T09:45:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,I have a 32 MB machine that crunches along with Ubuntu
2005-04-08T09:45:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,it runs blackbox
2005-04-08T09:45:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,ah...
2005-04-08T09:45:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,good thought
2005-04-08T12:02:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"ok, what's wrong with backports?"
2005-04-08T12:02:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i have gaim+gtk2.6+firefox only :)
2005-04-08T12:02:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"well, maybe a few other small packages that looked nice, but not much"
2005-04-08T12:02:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,some are quite poorly versioned and will cause dist-upgrade ditches
2005-04-08T12:02:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,suppose it's talked about on the forum somewheres?
2005-04-08T12:03:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,uninstallation instructions?
2005-04-08T12:03:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"your best bet is to uninstall all backports prior to dist-upgrading on 6 abril, 2005"
2005-04-08T12:05:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"are the new ubp versions safe, or you don't know?"
2005-04-08T12:05:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,ubp?
2005-04-08T12:06:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,they changed how backports were versioned to try and solve these problems at one time i believe
2005-04-08T12:07:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"I don't follow ubp, so unfortunately I can't comment.  I do know that as a universe maintainer, it is extremely difficult to track all the different external repos and have their packages interoperate smoothly with ubuntu's."
2005-04-11T14:27:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,*laughs*
2005-04-11T14:27:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,you know anything about X.org?
2005-04-11T14:28:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"i upgraded to Hoary and it all works, but X doesn't un-initialize or something on shutdown and my display just says 'bad signal' (you know the error) i have to hit ctrl-alt-del (And the system shutsdown normall)..."
2005-04-11T14:28:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,any ideas?
2005-04-11T14:29:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"oh, and would you know how to tell debian to generate a new xorg.conf?  it's using my old one (i had a custom x.org with warty)... and it didn't touch it... so i'd like to see what it's sane default would be"
2005-04-11T14:29:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"need more diagnostic info, like /var/log/Xorg.0.log and /etc/X11/xorg.conf in addition to lspci -v, lsmod, and dmesg output"
2005-04-11T14:30:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,yikes :)
2005-04-11T14:30:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i'll see if this latest xorg update fixes it first
2005-04-11T14:31:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,oh?
2005-04-11T14:31:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,so i should expect it to not fix it?
2005-04-11T14:31:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"no, unless it's dependent on migrating your earlier XF86Config-4/xorg.conf"
2005-04-11T14:32:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,xserver-xorg postinst warning: not updating /etc/X11/xorg.conf; file has
2005-04-11T14:32:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,if i remove it will reinstalling xserver-xorg give me a new file i wonder...
2005-04-11T14:34:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"ah, no i have a default again... so i'll try with that"
2005-04-11T14:44:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"how do i get all that to you? (i'm not a total newbie here, fyi... X.org.log the only real error is the synaptics driver - which i don't have)"
2005-04-11T14:44:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i'm still seeing if the newer kernel might somehow fix it
2005-04-11T14:44:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,pastebin.com
2005-04-11T14:50:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,what info do you need again?
2005-04-11T14:52:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,?
2005-04-11T14:52:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"i got Xorg.log, xorg.conf, and lspci ready... did you mention something else?  sorry, in and out of X/irssi/etc, can't scroll up to look"
2005-04-11T14:53:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,lsmod and dmesg
2005-04-11T14:54:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,are they all supposed to fit in one?
2005-04-11T14:54:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i just posted a bunch and it's all coming back blank?
2005-04-11T14:54:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"ah, there we do"
2005-04-11T14:55:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,the rest is coming right up

2005-04-11T14:59:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,did ya get?
2005-04-11T14:59:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"yes, but a bit busy atm"
2005-04-11T15:01:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"just whenever you get a sec, i'll limp along change to terminals and killing X till then i suppose :)"
2005-04-11T15:01:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,will get to it shortly :)
2005-04-11T15:01:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"thanks, really appreciate it"
2005-04-11T15:02:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"i'm thinking it won't be simple, but love it if it is"
2005-04-11T15:19:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,reading
2005-04-11T15:20:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,thanks
2005-04-11T15:21:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,please add Option 'ForceInit' to Section 'Device'
2005-04-11T15:21:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,then restart gdm
2005-04-11T15:22:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"i start x from the console, i assume 'restart x' would suffice then?"
2005-04-11T15:22:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"well, 'startx', but yes"
2005-04-11T15:23:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,then try and quit again and see if it's fixed?
2005-04-11T15:23:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"however you could reproduce it before, yes"
2005-04-11T15:24:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,brb then
2005-04-11T15:49:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,no dice
2005-04-11T15:50:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"'video mode not supported' whenever i quite X, though i can up-arrow and run X again with no problems... just can't get a console..."
2005-04-11T15:50:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,and from X i can ctrl-alt-f1 easily enough...
2005-04-11T15:51:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"and while X Window System is running, switching to the terminal on tty1 (ctrl+alt+F1) gives you a working console?"
2005-04-11T15:51:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"yes, while X is running i can switch back and forth easily"
2005-04-11T15:55:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,next suggestion?
2005-04-11T15:56:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"at least now i can test without rebooting... (mess it up, restart x, console, kill x, restart x.....)"
2005-04-11T16:01:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,UseBios 'true' didn't help...
2005-04-11T16:02:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"oh, never mind, it's on by default"
2005-04-11T16:02:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"hum, I would have asked you to turn it off/use 'false'"
2005-04-11T16:03:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,want me to try that? :)
2005-04-11T16:03:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i'm also thinking of powering down the laptop completely (can't think if i've done that since i was using DRI before)
2005-04-11T16:03:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"false it is, brb"
2005-04-11T16:10:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"ok, set it to false... first time had some static on the screen when moving things, but it seems to be working just spiffy now"
2005-04-11T16:11:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,thanks for your help!
2005-04-11T16:11:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"in the next few days i'll be getting DRI working on here again, so that should be fun :)"
2005-04-11T16:12:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,fun
2005-04-11T16:14:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,*shrugs* glad i only see it once every 60 days or so :)
2005-04-12T05:24:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,where are thos xfce packages? :)
2005-04-14T07:09:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,make sure you're running the latest Hoary kernel
2005-04-14T07:10:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,were there known problems with one a few days ago?
2005-04-14T07:11:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"if one is very, very savvy with kernel exploits, possibly"
2005-04-14T07:11:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"in most situations, however, it's a userspace application that's not freeing/deleting dynamically allocated memory properly"
2005-04-14T07:11:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,ah... i will reboot here in a sec (i noticed the kernel upgrade a day or two ago)...
2005-04-14T07:12:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i didn't know apps could do that... there isn't OS cleanup or something?
2005-04-14T07:12:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"if only, heh."
2005-04-14T07:13:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"well, how would one go about tracking which program it is?"
2005-04-14T07:13:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"there are a number of C library options; on a per-application basis, try running with valgrind"
2005-04-14T07:13:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,that quickly moves into development territory
2005-04-14T07:14:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"ah, i see"
2005-04-14T08:15:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,how are you using pidof?
2005-04-14T08:15:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,pidof name
2005-04-14T08:16:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,that returns pids
2005-04-14T08:16:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"except in this case it doesn't return anything, which is my problem"
2005-04-14T08:16:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,use pgrep instead
2005-04-14T08:16:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"i would blame it on the fact that it's a bash script, but killall seems to know what to do with it"
2005-04-14T08:17:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,thanks!
2005-04-14T08:17:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,np
2005-04-14T08:21:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,use a pid file or a stamp file in a secure fashion.
2005-04-14T08:23:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"ah, just compairing against $$ works"
2005-04-15T15:23:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,you around?
2005-04-15T15:24:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,yes?
2005-04-15T15:25:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"i have a via82xx chipset and the audio driver is blocking gnome from starting... same effect on hoary as warty, so the new kernel didn't help"
2005-04-15T15:25:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"removing the snd_82xx (not sure exactly name) or killing esd repeatedly allows gnome to start, any ideas?"
2005-04-15T15:27:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,I'm not sure what you're saying; is snd_via82xx actually hanging the system?
2005-04-15T15:28:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"the system isn't hanging, but gnome either displays a brown background (warty) or doesn't even get that far (hoary)... it just sets there... i didn't give it more than 2-3 minutes... rmmoding the sound driver... or killing esd a few times will 'jumpstart' things"
2005-04-15T15:28:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"obviously these are permanent solutions, so i was hoping yuo'd have suggestions"
2005-04-15T15:29:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"ok, first thing to test is whether gnome starts successfully with the setting 'Enable sound server startup' _UN_checked"
2005-04-15T15:29:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"ok :) i think that'll prove me point, but hold on :)"
2005-04-15T15:30:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,brb
2005-04-15T15:31:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,starts flawlessly without a sound daemon
2005-04-15T15:31:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"ie, unchecked"
2005-04-15T15:33:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"i guess the next thing would be to see if sound works from the console via alsa, or no/"
2005-04-15T15:33:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,yes
2005-04-15T15:34:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"well, darn i have no speakers..."
2005-04-15T15:35:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"and is it works from console, bug against esd, if not i might just be stuck?"
2005-04-15T15:35:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,no headphones here either :)
2005-04-15T15:35:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,does hoary have the latest alsa?
2005-04-15T15:35:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"not necessarily an esd bug, since if you start esd from the terminal and use an esd app, and it works, then that shoots that theory"
2005-04-15T15:36:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"ok, so basically get speakers and play around?"
2005-04-15T15:36:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"no, Hoary's kernel contains 1.0.6, which is ~2 revisions older than the latest."
2005-04-15T15:36:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,how hard is it to get the latest?
2005-04-15T15:36:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"fortunately, 'alsa-source' is 1.0.8, which is currently the newest."
2005-04-15T15:37:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i'm apt-getting alsa-source now
2005-04-15T15:37:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"i think upgraded to the latest will be quickest... then if no problem, i'll assume it's fixed"
2005-04-15T15:37:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,you'll also need 'linux-headers-$(uname -r)' and 'build-essential'
2005-04-15T15:38:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,(1.0.9 is right around the corner)
2005-04-15T15:38:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,good notes
2005-04-15T15:38:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,ah
2005-04-15T15:38:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"well, this is a GREAT PC, but without sound it's gonna kinda suck"
2005-04-15T15:38:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"wait, once hoary freezes 1.0.9 will be harder to get, no?"
2005-04-15T15:40:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"ok, i don't REALLY need build-essential (which includes g++) i just need MOST of it, right? :)"
2005-04-15T15:40:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"you need build-essential, linux-headers-$(uname -r), and alsa-source"
2005-04-15T15:41:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,ok ok :)
2005-04-15T15:46:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,have you had lots of people that needed to upgrade to get their sound working?
2005-04-15T15:47:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,or anyone?
2005-04-15T15:47:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"quite a few, but they are hardly the norm"
2005-04-15T15:47:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,ah...
2005-04-15T15:47:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"many, many more have simply dist-upgraded flawlessly"
2005-04-15T15:47:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,any with this hardware?
2005-04-15T15:47:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"iirc, yes"
2005-04-15T15:47:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"well, like i said warty never worked either on this box :)"
2005-04-15T15:47:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,same issue
2005-04-15T15:50:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,downloading
2005-04-15T15:52:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,are their instructions anywhere for nvidia with ubuntu? (i'm sure there are)
2005-04-15T15:52:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto
2005-04-15T15:53:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,should i follow the wiki over the guide?
2005-04-15T15:53:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,reconcile both :)
2005-04-15T15:53:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"ok :) this sytem is already so fast though, i can hardly imagine it getting faster"
2005-04-15T15:54:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,guess that's what i get for using a slow 900 laptop all this time :)
2005-04-15T15:55:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"sure, TNT-based"
2005-04-15T15:55:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"though if you don't need hardware 3D acceleration, 'nv' will suffice."
2005-04-15T15:55:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i want the cool screensavers :-)
2005-04-15T15:56:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,this will be a dual-head monster when i'm done with it
2005-04-16T05:25:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,hey!
2005-04-16T05:25:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i still don't know if sound works (no speakers) but alsa 1.0.8 from source fixed gnome starting problem :)
2005-04-16T05:25:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,thanks :)
2005-04-16T05:26:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,thanks again!
2005-04-16T10:02:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"i just switched to binary, and again i can tell things are popping up faster and DRI is enables (glxinfo) but still slow glxgears"
2005-04-16T07:55:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"different video card, different system, simliar problem... but i can't even get console with VT-switching..."
2005-04-16T08:00:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,is that an apt-way to get older nvidia-glx releases?
2005-04-16T08:00:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,'easy' - not really
2005-04-16T08:00:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,'doable' - yes
2005-04-16T08:00:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,try 1.0-7174
2005-04-16T08:00:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,you have any idea what might be up with my new setup?
2005-04-16T08:01:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"yeah, i'm headed to 7174 now"
2005-04-16T08:01:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,there seem to be issues with amd64
2005-04-16T08:01:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"I can't vouch for them, though, since I have no amd64"
2005-04-16T08:01:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i might just have to give up nvidia dreams... i remember (on gentoo) years ago the drivers never worked exactly right...
2005-04-16T08:01:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,k7 here
2005-04-16T08:02:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,what motherboard?
2005-04-16T08:02:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,biostar
2005-04-16T08:04:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,which chipset?
2005-04-16T08:04:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"oh, btw, thanks... recompiling alsa fixed that glitch :)"
2005-04-16T08:04:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,via8233
2005-04-16T08:04:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"i blacklisted via_agp so nvidia's agp stuff could work, but the problem occurs either way"
2005-04-16T08:04:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,those via8233s are a _world_ of trouble with athlons.
2005-04-16T08:04:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,I know from firsthand experience.
2005-04-16T08:04:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,try booting with noapic
2005-04-16T08:04:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,how so?
2005-04-16T08:05:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,my usb subsystem kept crashing until i flashed the bios :)
2005-04-16T08:06:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"so that's a good thing, i should just add it to my boot.lst?"
2005-04-16T08:06:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,or test it first?
2005-04-16T08:06:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,test it first
2005-04-16T08:06:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"i got this system (AXP 1800, 512mb, 20+40gig, etc) from my uncle for $25, i didn't pay too much, did I? :)"
2005-04-16T08:07:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,some hardware is not worth the hassle regardless the cost
2005-04-16T08:07:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,please don't tell me that's what i have
2005-04-16T08:07:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,because it seems QUIET speedy and solid outside of the nvidia issues
2005-04-16T08:08:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"and i'm only running of fthe 20go (20mb/s) drive, the 40g is double fast"
2005-04-16T08:10:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,nope
2005-04-16T08:11:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"so, the system isn't THAT terrible, is it? :)"
2005-04-16T08:11:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,it can be. Mine was awful.
2005-04-16T08:11:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,oh :(
2005-04-16T08:11:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,reliability or just incompatibility?
2005-04-16T08:12:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,reliability
2005-04-16T08:12:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,how long ago was this
2005-04-16T08:12:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,because my 2001 bios sure seemed crappy...
2005-04-16T08:12:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,I'm still using the same system with noapic
2005-04-16T08:12:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,2002 is behaving better
2005-04-16T08:12:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,ah :)
2005-04-16T08:12:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,you have nvidia?
2005-04-16T08:13:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,yup
2005-04-16T08:13:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,but never seem the issue i'm having with screens?
2005-04-16T08:13:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,I saw it constantly in newer kernels unless I used noapic
2005-04-16T08:14:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"well, then... i upgrade to the latest driver, and if that doesn't fix it i try nopaic :)"
2005-04-16T08:19:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,what does noapic actually do?
2005-04-16T08:22:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,disables one of the APIC controllers on your motherboard
2005-04-16T10:02:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i still can't get to a console... and noapic didn't seem to do anything
2005-04-16T10:02:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,kernel still said apic was found and enabled
2005-04-17T08:44:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"noapic didn't have any effect, do you suggest trying nolapic and combos of each?"
2005-04-17T08:47:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,what about pci=noacpi?
2005-04-17T08:47:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"ok, i'll try that"
2005-04-17T09:49:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,and then
2005-04-17T09:51:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,next step?
2005-04-17T09:52:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"in fact i'd take a list, i'm just plugging away"
2005-04-17T09:52:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"sorry, I'm kinda busy atm"
2005-04-20T10:32:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,you can't search the dumb nv forums without registering
2005-04-20T10:32:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,so register
2005-04-20T10:33:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"i did, but i haven't got an e-mai lfrom them"
2005-04-20T10:33:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i'd never make an otherwise public form and require an account just to search :(
2005-04-20T10:33:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,why can't the world just all share my sensabilities? :)
2005-04-20T10:46:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,can i totally stop vesafb from loading?
2005-04-20T10:46:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i think it might be interferring witht my video
2005-04-20T10:46:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,blacklist it
2005-04-20T10:46:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,in /etc/hotplug/blacklist?
2005-04-20T10:46:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,echo vesafb | sudo tee -a /etc/hotplug/blacklist
2005-04-20T10:47:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,vesafb
2005-04-20T10:47:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"those lines are in there, with no effect"
2005-04-20T10:47:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i reboot and it's still there
2005-04-20T10:49:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,any other suggestions?
2005-04-20T10:49:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"via_agp in there works (ie, it doesn't load) but vesafb in the blacklist seems to have no effect"
2005-04-20T10:50:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,would i need to include like cfbimbblt (and things that depend on vesafb) as well?
2005-04-20T10:51:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i'm tempted to just go move the modules
2005-04-20T10:51:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,that's a last-ditch
2005-04-20T10:51:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"well, havint them in blacklist has 0 effect"
2005-04-20T10:53:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,maybe it's not started by hotplug?
2005-04-20T10:54:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,not sure regarding your issue(s)
2005-04-20T10:54:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i will move the modules :) not like i use them... if upgrading to hoary release doesn't magically resovle it that is
2005-04-20T11:00:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,do you know anyone else who's put vesafb there and it's prevented it from loading?
2005-04-20T11:00:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,me.
2005-04-20T11:00:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,oh
2005-04-20T11:01:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,hmmmm
2005-04-20T11:01:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,hmmmmmm
2005-04-20T11:02:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"the lines don't have to be in any order, right?"
2005-04-20T11:02:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,not that I'm aware of. I just used vesafb.
2005-04-20T11:11:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,did you have to put fbcon or anything else in your blacklist for it to work?
2005-04-20T11:11:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,no
2005-04-20T11:11:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,ok
2005-04-20T11:14:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,is software raid0 really any good?
2005-04-20T11:45:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"anyway to find out at what part of the boot vesafb is even loaded, or why?"
2005-04-20T12:42:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,near as i can determine i have to remaster the ubuntu initrd to stop vesafb from being loaded
2005-04-20T12:58:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"one remastered initrd later, nope, not vesafb :) though i have NO idea how you turn yorus off, since it's modprobed in the initrd"
2005-04-20T08:20:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"no, recompiling nvidia.ko won't affect it."
2005-04-20T08:21:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,have you tried simply specifying on boot (the kernel command line) to use regular vga?
2005-04-20T13:13:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,should nvidia _require_ that agpgart be loaded?
2005-04-20T13:13:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,it doesn't.
2005-04-20T13:13:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i can't modprobe it on mine without it without missing symbol errors :-/
2005-04-20T13:13:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,so i'm unique?
2005-04-20T13:15:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i'm thinking maybe they are conflicting (althoguh in X it seems to work find and /proc says it's using nvidia's AGP)... but i'm thinking of anything and everything
2005-04-20T13:18:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i'm building nvidia from source
2005-04-20T13:19:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,nvidia: Unknown symbol agp_bind_memory
2005-04-20T13:20:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i just like 10 or these errors trying to insert it without agpgart loaded
2005-04-20T15:09:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,fixed it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
2005-04-20T15:10:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"well, sorta... evidentally when i boot both video ports (i have a dual-out card) are mirrored... but after X is started and returns to console the console is only on right port (i was using the left)... i guess it should bother me that it isn't both (since I imagine with nv it's both) but now i can switch to console... and i'll prolly be happy until i switch to two monitors and see if that causes new problems :)"
2005-04-29T09:55:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,i got thru 3 tests aok... i don't have time to do that now obviously... i booted into 2.6.8.1... we'll see how it goes
2005-05-29T11:06:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,-rwsr-xr--  1 root plugdev 17016 2005-04-04 12:38 /usr/bin/pumount
2005-05-29T11:08:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,thanks ;-)
2005-06-04T10:06:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,don't guess anyone else started reporting memory leaks?
2005-06-04T10:06:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,nafaik
2005-08-23T13:38:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,that's because nautilus is actually covering up Xfce's
2005-08-23T13:38:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,but i killed it
2005-08-23T13:38:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,did you clear ~/.cache too?
2005-08-23T13:39:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"next time, pass --no-desktop to nautilus"
2005-08-23T13:39:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,yeah :) so i can't get my desktop back now without restarting X?
2005-08-23T13:40:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,you did or didn't remove ~/.cache?
2005-08-23T13:40:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"interesting, what is .cache?"
2005-08-23T13:41:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,it's Xfce's cache dir
2005-08-23T13:41:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"ok, i removed it"
2005-08-23T13:41:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"restarting Xfce should suffice, then"
2005-08-23T13:42:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,man
2005-08-23T13:42:00.000Z,crimsun,Dreamer3,"essentially, yes"
2005-08-23T13:43:00.000Z,Dreamer3,crimsun,"well, there is a way to remove it :)"
