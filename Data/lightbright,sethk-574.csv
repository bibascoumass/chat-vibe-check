2005-11-26T08:23:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"with modern drive hardware, there is no good reason not to use a single large partition"
2005-11-26T08:24:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,"ok ill use the whole drive!  I thought it was a good diea to have /home on seperate partition, but it didnt do me any good :)  ill use the whole drive"
2005-11-26T08:25:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"I don't see where is makes any difference, and I've been doing this for a long time."
2005-11-26T08:25:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"people talk about umounting things for reinstalls, or other bizarre circumstances, but they don't really come up."
2005-11-26T08:26:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk, so you have only 2 partitons?  hda1 = / and hda5 = swap?
2005-11-26T08:26:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,that's what I do on my boxes with 40 gig
2005-11-26T08:26:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,although not hda5
2005-11-26T08:26:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,that's dumb.  hda2
2005-11-26T08:26:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,ok ill do that now!  use the whole drive for /
2005-11-26T08:26:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,why have overhead involved with an extended partition?
2005-11-26T08:27:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,"when I chose use whole drive, Ubuntu created swap by itself on hd5"
2005-11-26T08:27:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"I know, but override it."
2005-11-26T08:27:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"it's a machine, you are smarter than it is"
2005-11-26T08:27:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,"if you install Breezy and tell it to use whoile drive, it will use hda1 for / and create a hda5 for swap!  thats whats its doing by itself"
2005-11-26T08:28:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,I know
2005-11-26T08:28:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,that's why I said to change it
2005-11-26T08:28:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,why would it hurt to have it as hda5?
2005-11-26T08:28:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"a bit less efficient.  Only a hair, but why put up with it?"
2005-11-26T08:28:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,why does it hurt?
2005-11-26T08:28:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,and what happened to hda2 and 3 and 4?
2005-11-26T08:28:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,because hda5 is a pseudo partition in hda4
2005-11-26T08:29:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"and in your case hda2 and hda3 are unused, which is the point"
2005-11-26T08:29:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,but I dont ever see the swap anyway!  i leave it alone
2005-11-26T08:29:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"I know, but if it is used, then it matters.  The kernel uses it if you run out of real memory"
2005-11-26T08:29:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"but if you aren't comfortable mucking around with it, don't worry"
2005-11-26T08:29:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,it's trivial to change it later if you want
2005-11-26T08:30:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,it's a somewhat academic objection on my part.
2005-11-26T08:30:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,ok :)
2005-11-26T08:30:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,how can I change it from hda5 to hda2?
2005-11-26T08:31:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"you use fdisk.  delete hda5, and hda4.  then create hda2, and mark it as swap"
2005-11-26T08:31:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"but, thinking about it, you would also have to change the config, which is easy (for me) but possibly something you don't want to deal with at the moment"
2005-11-26T08:31:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"do it later, you don't lose anything"
2005-11-26T08:31:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,when I type cfdisk /dev/hda it says FATAL error
2005-11-26T08:31:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,you mean change fstab?
2005-11-26T08:32:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,right
2005-11-26T08:32:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,when I type cfdisk /dev/hda it says FATAL error!  what is the problem?
2005-11-26T08:32:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,there could be a swapon statement somewhere also.
2005-11-26T08:32:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,"I can change fstab to hda2, takes me 2 seconds"
2005-11-26T08:32:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"I don't know, I never use cfdisk"
2005-11-26T08:32:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,I just use fdisk
2005-11-26T08:32:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"you have to run it as root, of course"
2005-11-26T08:33:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,i loaded cfdisk hda!  how do I now tell it to use hda2?
2005-11-26T08:33:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,can I delete hda5 while Ubintu is runnung?
2005-11-26T08:34:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,you would want to take the swap out of service
2005-11-26T08:35:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,ok done!  I deleted hda5 and said NEW and it picked hda2 and I wrote it
2005-11-26T08:35:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"do a swapon then, on /dev/hda2"
2005-11-26T08:35:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,it seemed I could do it while running Ubtunu
2005-11-26T08:35:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"if the swap is off line, sure"
2005-11-26T08:35:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,"I then told fdisk to use hda2 as 82, swap"
2005-11-26T08:35:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,good
2005-11-26T08:35:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,whats my next step?
2005-11-26T08:36:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk, change fstab?
2005-11-26T08:36:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,right
2005-11-26T08:36:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,anything else?
2005-11-26T08:36:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"do a swapon /dev/hda2, so you don't have to reboot to get it to use fstab"
2005-11-26T08:36:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk, change fstab?  nothing else?
2005-11-26T08:36:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"that's all permanently, yes"
2005-11-26T08:36:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,type ' swapon /dev/hda2' ?
2005-11-26T08:36:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"right, with sudo"
2005-11-26T08:37:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,it said: swapon: /dev/hda2: Invalid argument
2005-11-26T08:37:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,you used sudu?
2005-11-26T08:37:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,"it typed the command as you gave me, and  it said: swapon: /dev/hda2: Invalid argument"
2005-11-26T08:38:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,yes I typed:  sudo swapon /dev/hda2
2005-11-26T08:38:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,do sudo mkswap /dev/hda2
2005-11-26T08:38:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,any other command?
2005-11-26T08:38:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,mkswap: error: swap area needs to be at least 40kB
2005-11-26T08:38:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,but its 756mb
2005-11-26T08:39:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"do fdisk -l /dev/hda, then paste the hda2 line"
2005-11-26T08:39:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,said: Cannot open /dev/hda
2005-11-26T08:39:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,sudo?
2005-11-26T08:39:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"anything related to partitions, swap, etc., you have to sudo"
2005-11-26T08:39:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,/dev/hda2            4773        4865      747022+  82  Linux swap / Solaris
2005-11-26T08:40:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,when I type cfdisk /dev/hda it reports that hda2 is 756MB
2005-11-26T08:40:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"yes, it is 107 cylinders or so, which is reasonable"
2005-11-26T08:41:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,so why isnt your comand working?
2005-11-26T08:41:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"do mount (with no arguments), see if swap is already mounted"
2005-11-26T08:41:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"it is possible that it still thinks the other partition is in place, if you didn't stop using the swap before you changed the partition table"
2005-11-26T08:41:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"if that happened, don't worry, it will just act weird until you reboot"
2005-11-26T08:41:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,where can I paste the output?
2005-11-26T08:42:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"you used the same physical area of the disk, so it isn't dangerous"
2005-11-26T08:42:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,use a pastebot.  there is one in the channel topic
2005-11-26T08:43:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"I have to walk the dog, but I'll be back shortly."
2005-11-26T08:43:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/4819
2005-11-26T08:43:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,can you look first? :P
2005-11-26T08:44:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,you cant give commands and then leave hafl way through :P
2005-11-26T08:44:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"I'll take a quick look, yes"
2005-11-26T08:44:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,but it doesn't take more than 10 minutes to walk the dog  :)
2005-11-26T08:45:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,ok and the output is here when you get bac: http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/4819
2005-11-26T08:45:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,I'm looking at it
2005-11-26T08:45:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,it doesn't show any swap.  I
2005-11-26T08:45:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"I'll think when I'm walking the dog.  :)  I verified the command on one of my systems here, and mkswap /dev/hda2 is correct"
2005-11-26T08:46:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,so what do I do now?
2005-11-26T08:46:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,so it has to be using an out of date cached copy of your partition table.
2005-11-26T08:46:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"reboot, force it to sync to the hardware"
2005-11-26T08:46:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"no, this is better, really"
2005-11-26T08:47:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,you think when I reboot it will fix itself
2005-11-26T08:47:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"yes.  you probably will have to do the mkswap, after you reboot"
2005-11-26T08:47:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"there is probably a way to do it without rebooting, but do the easy thing and reboot."
2005-11-26T08:47:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,partition tables are one of the few cases where a reboot may be needed in linux
2005-11-26T08:47:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,after I reboot I type  mkswap /dev/hda2 ?
2005-11-26T08:47:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,I changed the fstab to hda2
2005-11-26T08:48:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"first do mount (no arguments again).  if mount doesn't show the swap, then do mkswap /dev/hda2, and swapon /dev/hda2"
2005-11-26T08:48:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,can I jiust reboot X?
2005-11-26T08:48:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk, or a full reboot?
2005-11-26T08:48:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"no, X has nothing to do with it.  :)  full reboot"
2005-11-26T08:48:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,ok
2005-11-26T08:48:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"now the dog is insisting, but I'll be right back.  :)"
2005-11-26T08:48:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,enjoy your walk :)
2005-11-26T08:49:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,ok
2005-11-26T09:28:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,you back? :)
2005-11-28T13:04:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"sure, but what are you trying to accomplish by doing that?"
2005-11-28T13:07:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,what are you trying to accomplish?  Or recover from?  or what?
2005-11-28T13:18:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,hi :)
2005-11-28T13:18:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,my friend deleted his /home and he said he cant now load Ubuntu!  whats the best way to fix as he said it says something about cant load because /home is missing
2005-11-28T13:19:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"well, everyone here agrees that it should boot without home.  Ignoring that, however..."
2005-11-28T13:19:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,mkdir /home
2005-11-28T13:19:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,then create each user
2005-11-28T13:20:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"but there's a snag, as you can't create users who already exist"
2005-11-28T13:20:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,mkdir /home from where?
2005-11-28T13:20:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,anywhere.  it's a full path.
2005-11-28T13:20:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,"yeah its ok, I will get him to reinsall eveything from strach"
2005-11-28T13:20:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,you cant type anything though
2005-11-28T13:20:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,it doesnt even load
2005-11-28T13:20:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"boot the cd in rescue mode, or use the live cd"
2005-11-28T13:21:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,ah ok thanks
2005-11-28T13:22:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,so you can run the installation CD and run 'rescue' ?
2005-11-28T13:23:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"I have to check the exact way to run rescue.  but press F1 at the prompt, it tells you all"
2005-11-28T13:25:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,cool thanks :)
2005-11-28T13:25:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,and intelikey thanks for your help!  see you tomorrow
2005-11-29T06:21:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,hello my young friend :)
2005-11-29T06:36:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,"yes good point indeed!  the onbaord is still activated and then ubuntu wants to use that only, but he chose something else, hence, no sound"
2005-11-29T06:36:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"not always, but when they use the same IRQ that tends to happen, I've noticed."
2005-11-29T06:36:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,yeah
2005-12-01T08:44:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,I use the numbers because I remmber them easier :)
2005-12-01T08:44:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,they are error prone and very much the wrong way to do things
2005-12-01T08:44:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,error prone?  you mean theres a bug in Linux that I can enter 7 and it doesnt do it?
2005-12-01T08:44:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,absolutely error prone.
2005-12-01T08:45:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,error prone?  you mean theres a bug in Linux that I can enter 7 and it doesnt do it?
2005-12-01T08:45:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,agreement with that is directly proportional to experience in unix.
2005-12-01T08:45:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"no, I mean there is a bug in every human being and you will use the wrong number"
2005-12-01T08:45:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"that's why the symbols were added, in 1974"
2005-12-01T08:45:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,how come nobody else I have heard say there is a bug in linux's chmod using numbers?
2005-12-01T08:46:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,because you didn't here me say it either
2005-12-01T08:46:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,I said it is error prone
2005-12-01T08:46:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,how exactly it is error prone?  what you mean exactly pls?
2005-12-01T08:46:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"take absolutely any text on software practices, and in the first few sentences you will find the words 'do not use literal numbers'"
2005-12-01T08:46:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"you type in the wrong number, because you are doing a calculation in your head"
2005-12-01T08:46:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,"you mean if I enter for example chmod 777 filename, Linux can make an error?"
2005-12-01T08:47:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"no, _you_ can make an error"
2005-12-01T08:47:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,of course I suppose it is theoretically possible that linux _could_ make an error  :)
2005-12-01T08:47:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,ah heheh!  so user error not Linux error :)
2005-12-01T08:47:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"yes, absolutely"
2005-12-02T15:21:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,hello :)
2005-12-02T15:21:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,'evening
2005-12-02T15:22:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,morning :)  its 8am here
2005-12-02T15:22:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,details  :)
2005-12-02T15:22:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,im a Melencholy :)
2005-12-03T17:58:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,I got the kernel update on two systems.
2005-12-03T17:59:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,ok
2005-12-08T17:26:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"you probably need either firefox-bin, or the full path"
2005-12-08T06:13:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"it's ok, not perfect by any means"
2005-12-22T16:46:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"unless it is DVD-RAM, you can't"
2005-12-22T16:46:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,whats a dvd-ram?
2005-12-22T16:47:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,it's a DVD format that makes a DVD look like a random access device.  You treat DVD-RAM exactly as a hard drive
2005-12-22T16:48:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"so you can cp to it, dd to it, tar to it,"
2005-12-22T16:48:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,I heard there was a solution using 'mkudffs /dev/hdc'
2005-12-22T16:48:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"I guess it depends on what you mean by write directly.  I don't think that writes directly, but check it out?"
2005-12-22T16:49:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,according to Debian developer i need the udftools and 'mkudffs /dev/hdc'
2005-12-22T16:49:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"as I said, I don't consider that a direct write, but if it does what you need, go for it."
2005-12-22T16:49:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,ok
2006-01-20T15:17:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"unfortunately, no, dd doesn't have an option for that"
2006-01-20T15:18:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,so I type: 'dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/hdb1 bs=1024' ?  is that what Seveas told me?
2006-01-20T15:18:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"that seems reasonable, but since I don't know what you are trying to do ... (I just got here)"
2006-01-20T15:18:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,:) ah ok
2006-01-20T15:18:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,I asked; Seveas: how can I format or totally and securly wipe my whole hdb1 please?
2006-01-20T15:19:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,I would not write random data for that.  I would simply write zeroes.  It's much easier to verify that it worked
2006-01-20T15:19:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,so use  if=/dev/zero
2006-01-20T15:21:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,So I type: 'dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hdb1 bs=1024' ?
2006-01-20T15:22:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,that will work.  Leave out the bs=1024.  The optimal block size is the default.  Overriding it with bs either does nothing (if you happen to hit the optimum) or makes things slower
2006-01-20T15:22:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,So I type: 'dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hdb1' ? and sit back and wait? :)
2006-01-20T15:22:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,right
2006-01-20T15:22:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,ok thanks
2006-01-20T15:23:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"it wouldn't be all that difficult to make a script that prints something out once in a while, but it probably isn't worth the effort (that is, simulating a --verbose flag)"
2006-01-20T15:23:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,the problem is I cant tell how long its going to take or what its doing :P
2006-01-20T15:23:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"I know, I've said the same thing a number of times.  dd is actually quite fast, but with the size of today's drives, quite fast can still mean many minutes of waiting"
2006-01-20T15:23:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,how long would it take to finish on a 10gig hard drive you think?
2006-01-20T15:24:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"a 10 gig?  I'd guess 15 minutes,"
2006-01-20T15:24:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,why cant the developers add a verbose to dd?
2006-01-20T15:24:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"they can, I guess nobody has felt motivated.  You could actually download the source to it, and add it yourself, probably in about 15 minutes."
2006-01-20T15:25:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,yeah right :P lol
2006-01-20T15:25:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,im not a programmer
2006-01-20T15:25:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,do you use paypal?
2006-01-20T15:25:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"really, it's easy.  dd already has an integer variable where it is keeping the number of bytes, because it prints it at the end."
2006-01-20T15:25:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,I haven't set up paypal in a while.  I probably should again.
2006-01-20T15:25:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,ok
2006-01-20T15:25:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,I've been doing all my contract work for one company the past few months
2006-01-20T15:26:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,how is that going for you?
2006-01-20T15:26:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,it's going very well right now.  For a while there things were very slow
2006-01-20T15:26:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,ok great
2006-01-20T15:26:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"but when you have only one primary customer, you can lose that customer just like you can lose a job"
2006-01-20T15:27:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,"yes thats why I have created a passive income source of income, because 1. I dont like working if I have to. 2. You cant rely on work these days"
2006-01-20T15:27:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,so I get paid wether im sleeping or sittying on the beach :)
2006-01-20T15:28:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,"why dd is working , can I use my computer as normal?"
2006-01-20T15:29:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"sure.  It won't exactly be responsive, though ... :)"
2006-01-20T15:29:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,why = while
2006-01-20T15:29:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,"so in the future, if I want to wipe my whole hdb1, I just use: sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hdb1 ?"
2006-01-20T15:29:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,right.  you can wipe out the entire drie with /dev/hdb
2006-01-20T15:29:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,but of course with both of those you want to be very careful.  :)
2006-01-20T15:30:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,great!
2006-01-20T15:30:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,both of what?
2006-01-20T15:30:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,yes but im not dd hda :)
2006-01-20T15:45:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,you there?
2006-01-20T15:45:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,yes
2006-01-20T15:46:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,it finished! how can I verify that hdb1 is now been wiped with all zero's?
2006-01-20T15:46:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,with dd.  do something like:   dd if=/dev/hdb1 of=some.file bs=1024 count=4
2006-01-20T15:46:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,that will get the first four blocks
2006-01-20T15:47:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,I type: 'dd if=/dev/hdb1 of=some.file bs=1024 count=4' ?
2006-01-20T15:47:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,you can use skip= to skip data at the beginning and get something from the middle
2006-01-20T15:47:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"right, some.file being of course an arbitrary name"
2006-01-20T15:47:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,i dont underastans
2006-01-20T15:47:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,"I replace 'some,file' with what?"
2006-01-20T15:47:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"you are just using dd again, except instead of if and of both being devices, of is a file name"
2006-01-20T15:48:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,any name.  such as /home/lightbright/xyz
2006-01-20T15:48:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,"i dont underastand, sorry"
2006-01-20T15:48:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,or /tmp/something
2006-01-20T15:48:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,any old name in a directory where you have write privileges
2006-01-20T15:48:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,does the name have to be of an actual file?
2006-01-20T15:48:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,ok
2006-01-20T15:48:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"no.  If it is an actual file, the file will be erased"
2006-01-20T15:49:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,ok done!  What do I look for now?
2006-01-20T15:50:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,do this:  hexdump -C file.name
2006-01-20T15:50:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,I typed: ' sudo dd if=/dev/hdb1 of=hints.html bs=1024 count=4
2006-01-20T15:50:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,where file.name is whatever name you chose
2006-01-20T15:50:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,says: hexdump: index.html: No such file or directory
2006-01-20T15:51:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,that will print out the contents of that file as text (even though it's a binary file; you need hexdump to make the binary recognizable)
2006-01-20T15:51:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,you called your file index.html?
2006-01-20T15:51:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,00000000  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|
2006-01-20T15:51:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,im using hints.html
2006-01-20T15:51:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"looks good.  you wrote zeroes, and those are zeros"
2006-01-20T15:52:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,do I need to copy it to hdb1 first?
2006-01-20T15:53:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,so 'sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hdb1'  filled my whole hdb1 with zero's?
2006-01-20T15:53:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,right
2006-01-20T15:54:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,that hints.html is on my hda
2006-01-20T15:54:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"ok, but does that have anything to do with what we were talking about?"
2006-01-20T15:54:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,"no idea, you are very confusing"
2006-01-20T15:55:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,I said I wiped hdb1 and then you said do hexdump
2006-01-20T15:55:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,I said to do dd if=/dev/hdb1 of=some.file   and to THEN do hexdump on some.file
2006-01-20T15:55:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,ok let me try that
2006-01-20T15:56:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,remember the command with count=4  (you don't want it to copy the entire /dev/hdb1)
2006-01-20T15:57:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,"its ok I wont bother!  I did: 'sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hdb1' and thats all I will do :)  Ill trust that it wiped my hdb1, no need to check :P"
2006-01-20T15:58:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,it did  :)
2006-01-20T15:58:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,so I just remembered that there was a file I needed on hdb1!  How can I undelete it now?
2006-01-20T16:00:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,why does it now say: /dev/hdb1              16T   16T     0 100% /mnt
2006-01-20T16:10:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,what did you do to me? :P  now my hdb1 wont mount anymore
2006-01-20T16:10:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"of course not, you wiped it"
2006-01-20T16:11:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,hehe ok!  ill type: mkfs -t ext3 /dev/hdb1
2006-01-20T16:11:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,ok.  I use mkfs.ext3 /dev/hdb1  but the result is identical
2006-01-20T16:11:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,ah ok
2006-01-20T16:12:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,so sudo mkfs.ext3 /dev/hdb1 gives the exact same results as: mkfs -t ext3 /dev/hdb1 ?
2006-01-20T16:12:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,hes
2006-01-20T16:12:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,hes?
2006-01-20T16:12:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"yes, that is"
2006-01-20T16:13:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,ok :)
2006-01-20T16:13:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,does hdb1 need to be mounted for that command?
2006-01-20T16:14:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"you can't mount it before you make the file system, so the answer had better be no.  :)"
2006-01-20T16:14:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,"ignorare that last question, I realised after I asked it :P"
2006-01-20T16:16:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,ok all finished!  my hdb1 has been wiped clean!  Now the feds cant even undelete it according to some people :P
2006-01-20T16:16:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"the data is no  longer there, that is correct."
2006-01-20T16:16:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,yes but surely there is a way to get it with special hardware etc?
2006-01-20T16:17:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"no, not really.  you can't get the data back when the data is gone."
2006-01-20T16:17:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,hmm interesting
2006-01-20T16:17:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"I suppose it might leave quantum traces, but I don't think anyone has a way of gathering information from taht"
2006-01-20T16:18:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,how can I hear of so many people getting their computers ceased which was wiped and they find data on them?
2006-01-20T16:18:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,because they didn't really wipe them.  They just repartitioned and did mkfs
2006-01-20T16:18:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,you actually wrote over all the data with zeroes
2006-01-20T16:19:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,ah ok!  well sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hdb1 seems like a great secure command then!  Thanks for all your help
2006-01-20T16:19:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"if you do mkfs on a partition, it will appear to you to be empty, but in that case it is in fact recoverable, or at least much of it is."
2006-01-20T16:19:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"yes, writing over every sector of the disk is very very safe"
2006-01-20T16:19:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,should I do that more than once?
2006-01-20T16:20:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,do I need to type: sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hdb1' more than once. like 35 times or something?
2006-01-20T16:20:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,why are there some qipe programs that wipe 35 times if once is all thats needed?
2006-01-20T16:22:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,I can't imagine.  Writing zeroes once is the same as writing zeroes a million times.  There has never been a case of data being recovered from a disk where all the sectors were wiped.
2006-01-20T16:22:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"now, if you wanted to be totally paranoid, it still makes no sense to write repetatively.  You can write all 1's, then all 0's"
2006-01-20T16:22:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,but the possibility of recovering the data after writing over it is so small as to be effectively zeroes.
2006-01-20T16:23:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"I've done this for military projects, so I've studied the issue."
2006-01-20T16:45:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,why are there some wipe programs that wipe 35 times if once is all thats needed?
2006-01-20T16:46:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,?
2005-11-26T08:23:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"with modern drive hardware, there is no good reason not to use a single large partition"
2005-11-26T08:24:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,"ok ill use the whole drive!  I thought it was a good diea to have /home on seperate partition, but it didnt do me any good :)  ill use the whole drive"
2005-11-26T08:25:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"I don't see where is makes any difference, and I've been doing this for a long time."
2005-11-26T08:25:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"people talk about umounting things for reinstalls, or other bizarre circumstances, but they don't really come up."
2005-11-26T08:26:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk, so you have only 2 partitons?  hda1 = / and hda5 = swap?
2005-11-26T08:26:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,that's what I do on my boxes with 40 gig
2005-11-26T08:26:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,although not hda5
2005-11-26T08:26:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,that's dumb.  hda2
2005-11-26T08:26:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,ok ill do that now!  use the whole drive for /
2005-11-26T08:26:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,why have overhead involved with an extended partition?
2005-11-26T08:27:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,"when I chose use whole drive, Ubuntu created swap by itself on hd5"
2005-11-26T08:27:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"I know, but override it."
2005-11-26T08:27:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"it's a machine, you are smarter than it is"
2005-11-26T08:27:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,"if you install Breezy and tell it to use whoile drive, it will use hda1 for / and create a hda5 for swap!  thats whats its doing by itself"
2005-11-26T08:28:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,I know
2005-11-26T08:28:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,that's why I said to change it
2005-11-26T08:28:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,why would it hurt to have it as hda5?
2005-11-26T08:28:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"a bit less efficient.  Only a hair, but why put up with it?"
2005-11-26T08:28:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,why does it hurt?
2005-11-26T08:28:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,and what happened to hda2 and 3 and 4?
2005-11-26T08:28:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,because hda5 is a pseudo partition in hda4
2005-11-26T08:29:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"and in your case hda2 and hda3 are unused, which is the point"
2005-11-26T08:29:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,but I dont ever see the swap anyway!  i leave it alone
2005-11-26T08:29:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"I know, but if it is used, then it matters.  The kernel uses it if you run out of real memory"
2005-11-26T08:29:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"but if you aren't comfortable mucking around with it, don't worry"
2005-11-26T08:29:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,it's trivial to change it later if you want
2005-11-26T08:30:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,it's a somewhat academic objection on my part.
2005-11-26T08:30:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,ok :)
2005-11-26T08:30:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,how can I change it from hda5 to hda2?
2005-11-26T08:31:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"you use fdisk.  delete hda5, and hda4.  then create hda2, and mark it as swap"
2005-11-26T08:31:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"but, thinking about it, you would also have to change the config, which is easy (for me) but possibly something you don't want to deal with at the moment"
2005-11-26T08:31:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"do it later, you don't lose anything"
2005-11-26T08:31:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,when I type cfdisk /dev/hda it says FATAL error
2005-11-26T08:31:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,you mean change fstab?
2005-11-26T08:32:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,right
2005-11-26T08:32:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,when I type cfdisk /dev/hda it says FATAL error!  what is the problem?
2005-11-26T08:32:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,there could be a swapon statement somewhere also.
2005-11-26T08:32:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,"I can change fstab to hda2, takes me 2 seconds"
2005-11-26T08:32:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"I don't know, I never use cfdisk"
2005-11-26T08:32:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,I just use fdisk
2005-11-26T08:32:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"you have to run it as root, of course"
2005-11-26T08:33:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,i loaded cfdisk hda!  how do I now tell it to use hda2?
2005-11-26T08:33:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,can I delete hda5 while Ubintu is runnung?
2005-11-26T08:34:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,you would want to take the swap out of service
2005-11-26T08:35:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,ok done!  I deleted hda5 and said NEW and it picked hda2 and I wrote it
2005-11-26T08:35:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"do a swapon then, on /dev/hda2"
2005-11-26T08:35:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,it seemed I could do it while running Ubtunu
2005-11-26T08:35:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"if the swap is off line, sure"
2005-11-26T08:35:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,"I then told fdisk to use hda2 as 82, swap"
2005-11-26T08:35:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,good
2005-11-26T08:35:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,whats my next step?
2005-11-26T08:36:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk, change fstab?
2005-11-26T08:36:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,right
2005-11-26T08:36:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,anything else?
2005-11-26T08:36:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"do a swapon /dev/hda2, so you don't have to reboot to get it to use fstab"
2005-11-26T08:36:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk, change fstab?  nothing else?
2005-11-26T08:36:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"that's all permanently, yes"
2005-11-26T08:36:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,type ' swapon /dev/hda2' ?
2005-11-26T08:36:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"right, with sudo"
2005-11-26T08:37:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,it said: swapon: /dev/hda2: Invalid argument
2005-11-26T08:37:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,you used sudu?
2005-11-26T08:37:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,"it typed the command as you gave me, and  it said: swapon: /dev/hda2: Invalid argument"
2005-11-26T08:38:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,yes I typed:  sudo swapon /dev/hda2
2005-11-26T08:38:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,do sudo mkswap /dev/hda2
2005-11-26T08:38:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,any other command?
2005-11-26T08:38:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,mkswap: error: swap area needs to be at least 40kB
2005-11-26T08:38:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,but its 756mb
2005-11-26T08:39:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"do fdisk -l /dev/hda, then paste the hda2 line"
2005-11-26T08:39:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,said: Cannot open /dev/hda
2005-11-26T08:39:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,sudo?
2005-11-26T08:39:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"anything related to partitions, swap, etc., you have to sudo"
2005-11-26T08:39:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,/dev/hda2            4773        4865      747022+  82  Linux swap / Solaris
2005-11-26T08:40:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,when I type cfdisk /dev/hda it reports that hda2 is 756MB
2005-11-26T08:40:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"yes, it is 107 cylinders or so, which is reasonable"
2005-11-26T08:41:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,so why isnt your comand working?
2005-11-26T08:41:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"do mount (with no arguments), see if swap is already mounted"
2005-11-26T08:41:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"it is possible that it still thinks the other partition is in place, if you didn't stop using the swap before you changed the partition table"
2005-11-26T08:41:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"if that happened, don't worry, it will just act weird until you reboot"
2005-11-26T08:41:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,where can I paste the output?
2005-11-26T08:42:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"you used the same physical area of the disk, so it isn't dangerous"
2005-11-26T08:42:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,use a pastebot.  there is one in the channel topic
2005-11-26T08:43:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"I have to walk the dog, but I'll be back shortly."
2005-11-26T08:43:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/4819
2005-11-26T08:43:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,can you look first? :P
2005-11-26T08:44:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,you cant give commands and then leave hafl way through :P
2005-11-26T08:44:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"I'll take a quick look, yes"
2005-11-26T08:44:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,but it doesn't take more than 10 minutes to walk the dog  :)
2005-11-26T08:45:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,ok and the output is here when you get bac: http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/4819
2005-11-26T08:45:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,I'm looking at it
2005-11-26T08:45:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,it doesn't show any swap.  I
2005-11-26T08:45:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"I'll think when I'm walking the dog.  :)  I verified the command on one of my systems here, and mkswap /dev/hda2 is correct"
2005-11-26T08:46:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,so what do I do now?
2005-11-26T08:46:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,so it has to be using an out of date cached copy of your partition table.
2005-11-26T08:46:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"reboot, force it to sync to the hardware"
2005-11-26T08:46:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"no, this is better, really"
2005-11-26T08:47:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,you think when I reboot it will fix itself
2005-11-26T08:47:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"yes.  you probably will have to do the mkswap, after you reboot"
2005-11-26T08:47:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"there is probably a way to do it without rebooting, but do the easy thing and reboot."
2005-11-26T08:47:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,partition tables are one of the few cases where a reboot may be needed in linux
2005-11-26T08:47:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,after I reboot I type  mkswap /dev/hda2 ?
2005-11-26T08:47:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,I changed the fstab to hda2
2005-11-26T08:48:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"first do mount (no arguments again).  if mount doesn't show the swap, then do mkswap /dev/hda2, and swapon /dev/hda2"
2005-11-26T08:48:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,can I jiust reboot X?
2005-11-26T08:48:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk, or a full reboot?
2005-11-26T08:48:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"no, X has nothing to do with it.  :)  full reboot"
2005-11-26T08:48:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,ok
2005-11-26T08:48:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"now the dog is insisting, but I'll be right back.  :)"
2005-11-26T08:48:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,enjoy your walk :)
2005-11-26T08:49:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,ok
2005-11-26T09:28:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,you back? :)
2005-11-28T13:04:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"sure, but what are you trying to accomplish by doing that?"
2005-11-28T13:07:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,what are you trying to accomplish?  Or recover from?  or what?
2005-11-28T13:18:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,hi :)
2005-11-28T13:18:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,my friend deleted his /home and he said he cant now load Ubuntu!  whats the best way to fix as he said it says something about cant load because /home is missing
2005-11-28T13:19:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"well, everyone here agrees that it should boot without home.  Ignoring that, however..."
2005-11-28T13:19:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,mkdir /home
2005-11-28T13:19:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,then create each user
2005-11-28T13:20:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"but there's a snag, as you can't create users who already exist"
2005-11-28T13:20:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,mkdir /home from where?
2005-11-28T13:20:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,anywhere.  it's a full path.
2005-11-28T13:20:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,"yeah its ok, I will get him to reinsall eveything from strach"
2005-11-28T13:20:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,you cant type anything though
2005-11-28T13:20:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,it doesnt even load
2005-11-28T13:20:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"boot the cd in rescue mode, or use the live cd"
2005-11-28T13:21:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,ah ok thanks
2005-11-28T13:22:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,so you can run the installation CD and run 'rescue' ?
2005-11-28T13:23:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"I have to check the exact way to run rescue.  but press F1 at the prompt, it tells you all"
2005-11-28T13:25:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,cool thanks :)
2005-11-28T13:25:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,and intelikey thanks for your help!  see you tomorrow
2005-11-29T06:21:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,hello my young friend :)
2005-11-29T06:36:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,"yes good point indeed!  the onbaord is still activated and then ubuntu wants to use that only, but he chose something else, hence, no sound"
2005-11-29T06:36:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"not always, but when they use the same IRQ that tends to happen, I've noticed."
2005-11-29T06:36:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,yeah
2005-12-01T08:44:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,I use the numbers because I remmber them easier :)
2005-12-01T08:44:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,they are error prone and very much the wrong way to do things
2005-12-01T08:44:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,error prone?  you mean theres a bug in Linux that I can enter 7 and it doesnt do it?
2005-12-01T08:44:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,absolutely error prone.
2005-12-01T08:45:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,error prone?  you mean theres a bug in Linux that I can enter 7 and it doesnt do it?
2005-12-01T08:45:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,agreement with that is directly proportional to experience in unix.
2005-12-01T08:45:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"no, I mean there is a bug in every human being and you will use the wrong number"
2005-12-01T08:45:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"that's why the symbols were added, in 1974"
2005-12-01T08:45:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,how come nobody else I have heard say there is a bug in linux's chmod using numbers?
2005-12-01T08:46:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,because you didn't here me say it either
2005-12-01T08:46:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,I said it is error prone
2005-12-01T08:46:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,how exactly it is error prone?  what you mean exactly pls?
2005-12-01T08:46:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"take absolutely any text on software practices, and in the first few sentences you will find the words 'do not use literal numbers'"
2005-12-01T08:46:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"you type in the wrong number, because you are doing a calculation in your head"
2005-12-01T08:46:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,"you mean if I enter for example chmod 777 filename, Linux can make an error?"
2005-12-01T08:47:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"no, _you_ can make an error"
2005-12-01T08:47:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,of course I suppose it is theoretically possible that linux _could_ make an error  :)
2005-12-01T08:47:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,ah heheh!  so user error not Linux error :)
2005-12-01T08:47:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"yes, absolutely"
2005-12-02T15:21:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,hello :)
2005-12-02T15:21:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,'evening
2005-12-02T15:22:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,morning :)  its 8am here
2005-12-02T15:22:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,details  :)
2005-12-02T15:22:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,im a Melencholy :)
2005-12-03T17:58:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,I got the kernel update on two systems.
2005-12-03T17:59:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,ok
2005-12-08T17:26:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"you probably need either firefox-bin, or the full path"
2005-12-08T06:13:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"it's ok, not perfect by any means"
2005-12-22T16:46:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"unless it is DVD-RAM, you can't"
2005-12-22T16:46:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,whats a dvd-ram?
2005-12-22T16:47:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,it's a DVD format that makes a DVD look like a random access device.  You treat DVD-RAM exactly as a hard drive
2005-12-22T16:48:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"so you can cp to it, dd to it, tar to it,"
2005-12-22T16:48:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,I heard there was a solution using 'mkudffs /dev/hdc'
2005-12-22T16:48:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"I guess it depends on what you mean by write directly.  I don't think that writes directly, but check it out?"
2005-12-22T16:49:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,according to Debian developer i need the udftools and 'mkudffs /dev/hdc'
2005-12-22T16:49:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"as I said, I don't consider that a direct write, but if it does what you need, go for it."
2005-12-22T16:49:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,ok
2006-01-20T15:17:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"unfortunately, no, dd doesn't have an option for that"
2006-01-20T15:18:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,so I type: 'dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/hdb1 bs=1024' ?  is that what Seveas told me?
2006-01-20T15:18:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"that seems reasonable, but since I don't know what you are trying to do ... (I just got here)"
2006-01-20T15:18:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,:) ah ok
2006-01-20T15:18:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,I asked; Seveas: how can I format or totally and securly wipe my whole hdb1 please?
2006-01-20T15:19:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,I would not write random data for that.  I would simply write zeroes.  It's much easier to verify that it worked
2006-01-20T15:19:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,so use  if=/dev/zero
2006-01-20T15:21:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,So I type: 'dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hdb1 bs=1024' ?
2006-01-20T15:22:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,that will work.  Leave out the bs=1024.  The optimal block size is the default.  Overriding it with bs either does nothing (if you happen to hit the optimum) or makes things slower
2006-01-20T15:22:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,So I type: 'dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hdb1' ? and sit back and wait? :)
2006-01-20T15:22:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,right
2006-01-20T15:22:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,ok thanks
2006-01-20T15:23:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"it wouldn't be all that difficult to make a script that prints something out once in a while, but it probably isn't worth the effort (that is, simulating a --verbose flag)"
2006-01-20T15:23:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,the problem is I cant tell how long its going to take or what its doing :P
2006-01-20T15:23:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"I know, I've said the same thing a number of times.  dd is actually quite fast, but with the size of today's drives, quite fast can still mean many minutes of waiting"
2006-01-20T15:23:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,how long would it take to finish on a 10gig hard drive you think?
2006-01-20T15:24:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"a 10 gig?  I'd guess 15 minutes,"
2006-01-20T15:24:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,why cant the developers add a verbose to dd?
2006-01-20T15:24:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"they can, I guess nobody has felt motivated.  You could actually download the source to it, and add it yourself, probably in about 15 minutes."
2006-01-20T15:25:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,yeah right :P lol
2006-01-20T15:25:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,im not a programmer
2006-01-20T15:25:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,do you use paypal?
2006-01-20T15:25:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"really, it's easy.  dd already has an integer variable where it is keeping the number of bytes, because it prints it at the end."
2006-01-20T15:25:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,I haven't set up paypal in a while.  I probably should again.
2006-01-20T15:25:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,ok
2006-01-20T15:25:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,I've been doing all my contract work for one company the past few months
2006-01-20T15:26:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,how is that going for you?
2006-01-20T15:26:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,it's going very well right now.  For a while there things were very slow
2006-01-20T15:26:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,ok great
2006-01-20T15:26:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"but when you have only one primary customer, you can lose that customer just like you can lose a job"
2006-01-20T15:27:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,"yes thats why I have created a passive income source of income, because 1. I dont like working if I have to. 2. You cant rely on work these days"
2006-01-20T15:27:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,so I get paid wether im sleeping or sittying on the beach :)
2006-01-20T15:28:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,"why dd is working , can I use my computer as normal?"
2006-01-20T15:29:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"sure.  It won't exactly be responsive, though ... :)"
2006-01-20T15:29:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,why = while
2006-01-20T15:29:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,"so in the future, if I want to wipe my whole hdb1, I just use: sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hdb1 ?"
2006-01-20T15:29:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,right.  you can wipe out the entire drie with /dev/hdb
2006-01-20T15:29:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,but of course with both of those you want to be very careful.  :)
2006-01-20T15:30:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,great!
2006-01-20T15:30:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,both of what?
2006-01-20T15:30:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,yes but im not dd hda :)
2006-01-20T15:45:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,you there?
2006-01-20T15:45:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,yes
2006-01-20T15:46:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,it finished! how can I verify that hdb1 is now been wiped with all zero's?
2006-01-20T15:46:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,with dd.  do something like:   dd if=/dev/hdb1 of=some.file bs=1024 count=4
2006-01-20T15:46:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,that will get the first four blocks
2006-01-20T15:47:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,I type: 'dd if=/dev/hdb1 of=some.file bs=1024 count=4' ?
2006-01-20T15:47:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,you can use skip= to skip data at the beginning and get something from the middle
2006-01-20T15:47:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"right, some.file being of course an arbitrary name"
2006-01-20T15:47:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,i dont underastans
2006-01-20T15:47:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,"I replace 'some,file' with what?"
2006-01-20T15:47:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"you are just using dd again, except instead of if and of both being devices, of is a file name"
2006-01-20T15:48:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,any name.  such as /home/lightbright/xyz
2006-01-20T15:48:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,"i dont underastand, sorry"
2006-01-20T15:48:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,or /tmp/something
2006-01-20T15:48:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,any old name in a directory where you have write privileges
2006-01-20T15:48:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,does the name have to be of an actual file?
2006-01-20T15:48:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,ok
2006-01-20T15:48:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"no.  If it is an actual file, the file will be erased"
2006-01-20T15:49:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,ok done!  What do I look for now?
2006-01-20T15:50:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,do this:  hexdump -C file.name
2006-01-20T15:50:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,I typed: ' sudo dd if=/dev/hdb1 of=hints.html bs=1024 count=4
2006-01-20T15:50:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,where file.name is whatever name you chose
2006-01-20T15:50:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,says: hexdump: index.html: No such file or directory
2006-01-20T15:51:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,that will print out the contents of that file as text (even though it's a binary file; you need hexdump to make the binary recognizable)
2006-01-20T15:51:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,you called your file index.html?
2006-01-20T15:51:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,00000000  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|
2006-01-20T15:51:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,im using hints.html
2006-01-20T15:51:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"looks good.  you wrote zeroes, and those are zeros"
2006-01-20T15:52:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,do I need to copy it to hdb1 first?
2006-01-20T15:53:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,so 'sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hdb1'  filled my whole hdb1 with zero's?
2006-01-20T15:53:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,right
2006-01-20T15:54:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,that hints.html is on my hda
2006-01-20T15:54:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"ok, but does that have anything to do with what we were talking about?"
2006-01-20T15:54:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,"no idea, you are very confusing"
2006-01-20T15:55:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,I said I wiped hdb1 and then you said do hexdump
2006-01-20T15:55:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,I said to do dd if=/dev/hdb1 of=some.file   and to THEN do hexdump on some.file
2006-01-20T15:55:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,ok let me try that
2006-01-20T15:56:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,remember the command with count=4  (you don't want it to copy the entire /dev/hdb1)
2006-01-20T15:57:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,"its ok I wont bother!  I did: 'sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hdb1' and thats all I will do :)  Ill trust that it wiped my hdb1, no need to check :P"
2006-01-20T15:58:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,it did  :)
2006-01-20T15:58:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,so I just remembered that there was a file I needed on hdb1!  How can I undelete it now?
2006-01-20T16:00:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,why does it now say: /dev/hdb1              16T   16T     0 100% /mnt
2006-01-20T16:10:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,what did you do to me? :P  now my hdb1 wont mount anymore
2006-01-20T16:10:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"of course not, you wiped it"
2006-01-20T16:11:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,hehe ok!  ill type: mkfs -t ext3 /dev/hdb1
2006-01-20T16:11:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,ok.  I use mkfs.ext3 /dev/hdb1  but the result is identical
2006-01-20T16:11:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,ah ok
2006-01-20T16:12:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,so sudo mkfs.ext3 /dev/hdb1 gives the exact same results as: mkfs -t ext3 /dev/hdb1 ?
2006-01-20T16:12:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,hes
2006-01-20T16:12:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,hes?
2006-01-20T16:12:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"yes, that is"
2006-01-20T16:13:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,ok :)
2006-01-20T16:13:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,does hdb1 need to be mounted for that command?
2006-01-20T16:14:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"you can't mount it before you make the file system, so the answer had better be no.  :)"
2006-01-20T16:14:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,"ignorare that last question, I realised after I asked it :P"
2006-01-20T16:16:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,ok all finished!  my hdb1 has been wiped clean!  Now the feds cant even undelete it according to some people :P
2006-01-20T16:16:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"the data is no  longer there, that is correct."
2006-01-20T16:16:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,yes but surely there is a way to get it with special hardware etc?
2006-01-20T16:17:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"no, not really.  you can't get the data back when the data is gone."
2006-01-20T16:17:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,hmm interesting
2006-01-20T16:17:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"I suppose it might leave quantum traces, but I don't think anyone has a way of gathering information from taht"
2006-01-20T16:18:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,how can I hear of so many people getting their computers ceased which was wiped and they find data on them?
2006-01-20T16:18:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,because they didn't really wipe them.  They just repartitioned and did mkfs
2006-01-20T16:18:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,you actually wrote over all the data with zeroes
2006-01-20T16:19:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,ah ok!  well sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hdb1 seems like a great secure command then!  Thanks for all your help
2006-01-20T16:19:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"if you do mkfs on a partition, it will appear to you to be empty, but in that case it is in fact recoverable, or at least much of it is."
2006-01-20T16:19:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"yes, writing over every sector of the disk is very very safe"
2006-01-20T16:19:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,should I do that more than once?
2006-01-20T16:20:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,do I need to type: sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hdb1' more than once. like 35 times or something?
2006-01-20T16:20:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,why are there some qipe programs that wipe 35 times if once is all thats needed?
2006-01-20T16:22:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,I can't imagine.  Writing zeroes once is the same as writing zeroes a million times.  There has never been a case of data being recovered from a disk where all the sectors were wiped.
2006-01-20T16:22:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"now, if you wanted to be totally paranoid, it still makes no sense to write repetatively.  You can write all 1's, then all 0's"
2006-01-20T16:22:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,but the possibility of recovering the data after writing over it is so small as to be effectively zeroes.
2006-01-20T16:23:00.000Z,sethk,lightbright,"I've done this for military projects, so I've studied the issue."
2006-01-20T16:45:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,why are there some wipe programs that wipe 35 times if once is all thats needed?
2006-01-20T16:46:00.000Z,lightbright,sethk,?
