2007-01-03T08:29:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,did you back it up?
2007-01-03T08:36:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,it's not linux in general. it might be dapper. if you had edgy things might have went well
2007-01-03T08:36:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,shhhh

2007-01-03T08:45:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,why are you using dapper?
2007-01-03T08:46:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,no
2007-01-03T08:46:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,might/will save you some trouble. it might boot and work and everything!
2007-01-03T08:46:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,"unless you want to download and send me a cd, ok then"
2007-01-03T08:47:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,why? it wont take long to download if you have broadband
2007-01-03T08:47:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,edgy might have a fix that dapper doesnt have
2007-01-03T08:47:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,you should give it a try
2007-01-03T08:49:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,"its a 1 and a half hour download, no thank you, i'll work with what i got"
2007-01-03T08:49:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,youve been in here longer than that. you could have d/l it and had ubuntu up and running
2007-01-03T08:49:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,"i like to work with what i got, im asian, i have to, its in my blood"
2007-01-03T08:49:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,omg. download it and stop being retarded!

2007-01-03T08:51:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,being asian is no excuse. i know one who has gentoo up on his toaster and he didnt have that big of a hard time.
2007-01-03T08:51:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,well his toaster is new
2007-01-03T08:52:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,you do realize that edgy offers more support for more hardware and fixes certain issues that dapper has in the installation?
2007-01-03T08:53:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,"no, i no wanna download, i want this, im stubborn"
2007-01-03T08:55:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,that's the red screen of death

2007-01-05T08:06:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,"on edgy, in the boot menu, is there a way to change the boot option so it just installs?"
2007-01-05T08:06:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,hm
2007-01-05T08:07:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,i dont think so. i think what you need is the alternate cd. it does text installs
2007-01-05T08:08:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,"ok, how bout this deal, this no work, you change your name to hexis"
2007-01-05T08:08:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,it never was hexis
2007-01-05T08:08:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,er i read that wrong
2007-01-05T08:08:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,let me think.
2007-01-05T08:08:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,no.
2007-01-05T08:08:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,"ok fine, how bout getting me a torrent to the alternate install ^_^"
2007-01-05T08:09:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,alright

2007-01-05T08:13:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,"i dont know, what's wrong with getting it from a site?"
2007-01-05T08:14:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,"i wouldnt know whats a good site to search torrents,"
2007-01-05T08:14:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,i mean the direct ISO download
2007-01-05T08:15:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,do you prefer a torrent?
2007-01-05T08:16:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,it would be nice ^_^
2007-01-05T08:16:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,k
2007-01-05T08:16:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,http://isohunt.com/torrents/?ihq=ubuntu+alternate click on the first one. should say ubuntu-6.10-alternate-i386.iso
2007-01-05T08:17:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,^_^
2007-01-05T08:20:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,ive never used the alternate cd so....youre kind of on your own
2007-01-05T08:20:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,unless you explain what you se
2007-01-05T08:21:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,"ok, i'll give it a shot, i'll just need the basic commands for the install"
2007-01-05T08:21:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,i'll try :S
2007-01-05T08:47:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,whats the command to get to a terminal
2007-01-05T08:47:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,are you in X or what
2007-01-05T08:48:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,"na, i just need to get a terminal"
2007-01-05T08:48:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,what are you in now?
2007-01-05T08:48:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,"just the command, is it like get-apt, or what? im not in anything, I just need the command"
2007-01-05T08:49:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,see what Falstius said
2007-01-06T07:04:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,"ok, i have determined that its my hard drive like 3 sectors are thrashed, im amazed that windows installed, but ubuntu wont let me, unless the alternate works"
2007-01-06T07:04:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,i wouldnt count on it but go ahead and give it a try if you want
2007-01-06T07:05:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,"i prob will, and i'll prob get a small hd, you know where i could get a small gig hd other than ebay"
2007-01-06T07:05:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,"nope, not that i know of"
2007-01-06T07:06:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,"cause this comp is crap, and i dont want to put a 50 gig into it, not worth it"
2007-01-06T07:06:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,"yeah, that's reasonable. im sure there are like 10gb or so drives on ebay that sell pretty cheap"
2007-01-06T07:07:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,"cause if so, i'll just get a 2 gig from best buy or circuit city and do that"
2007-01-06T07:07:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,"maybe, it sounds like it would work. ive never done it before"
2007-01-06T07:08:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,"seems like a good idea, i think i found a flash drive install link on digg, maybe i'll write an article on it..."
2007-01-06T07:08:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,alright
2007-01-06T07:08:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,^_^
2007-01-06T07:45:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,"lol, i paused the torrent yesterday for some downloading updates, and now, there is only 1 seed, what do I do now?"
2007-01-06T07:45:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,cry
2007-01-06T07:46:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,"wait, its droping, seeds popin up"
2007-01-06T07:47:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,yeah just watch it

2007-01-10T06:49:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,haha
2007-01-10T06:50:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,"i dunno, about to scrap this comp, and get a recycle from my school"
2007-01-10T06:50:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,might do well
2007-01-10T06:51:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,"i dunno, i wanna get off of ebay, but kinda dont trust some of the stuff, and the places up here want an arm and leg for 40 gig"
2007-01-10T06:52:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,"i keep getting the mount error on 'block (1,0), wtf does that mean"
2007-01-10T06:53:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,is this the same drive?
2007-01-10T06:53:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,yesh
2007-01-10T06:53:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,it's probably bad

2007-01-10T07:10:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,the weird thing is i can install windows on it

2007-01-10T07:10:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,"lol, explain"
2007-01-10T07:11:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,i guess the windows install doesnt check the disk for problems
2007-01-10T07:11:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,"hmmm, anyway to bypass that in ubuntu?"
2007-01-10T07:11:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,not that i know of

2007-01-03T07:37:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,i have no idea what the hell youre even trying to do. im just catching some of your questions every now and then
2007-01-03T07:39:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,are you in edgy dapper or what
2007-01-03T07:40:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,then what's the problem? all you have to do is pop the CDs in and install
2007-01-03T07:40:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,"i did pop in the cd, then all these black screens with errors poped up"
2007-01-03T07:40:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,what did they say

2007-01-03T08:02:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,that would be great
2007-01-03T08:06:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,hes making me cry

2007-01-03T08:29:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,did you back it up?
2007-01-03T08:36:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,it's not linux in general. it might be dapper. if you had edgy things might have went well
2007-01-03T08:36:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,shhhh

2007-01-03T08:45:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,why are you using dapper?
2007-01-03T08:46:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,no
2007-01-03T08:46:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,might/will save you some trouble. it might boot and work and everything!
2007-01-03T08:46:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,"unless you want to download and send me a cd, ok then"
2007-01-03T08:47:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,why? it wont take long to download if you have broadband
2007-01-03T08:47:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,edgy might have a fix that dapper doesnt have
2007-01-03T08:47:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,you should give it a try
2007-01-03T08:49:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,"its a 1 and a half hour download, no thank you, i'll work with what i got"
2007-01-03T08:49:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,youve been in here longer than that. you could have d/l it and had ubuntu up and running
2007-01-03T08:49:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,"i like to work with what i got, im asian, i have to, its in my blood"
2007-01-03T08:49:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,omg. download it and stop being retarded!
2007-01-03T08:50:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,"no, i have to do it my way"

2007-01-03T08:50:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,and thats why im so damn lovable
2007-01-03T08:51:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,being asian is no excuse. i know one who has gentoo up on his toaster and he didnt have that big of a hard time.
2007-01-03T08:51:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,well his toaster is new
2007-01-03T08:52:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,you do realize that edgy offers more support for more hardware and fixes certain issues that dapper has in the installation?
2007-01-03T08:53:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,"no, i no wanna download, i want this, im stubborn"
2007-01-03T08:55:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,that's the red screen of death
2007-01-03T08:58:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,watch out. it'll blow up
2007-01-03T08:59:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,<3
2007-01-03T09:03:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,give it up. d/l edgy. you know you want to
2007-01-03T09:03:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,"no, thish weekend, then i give"
2007-01-03T09:06:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,it's fate that you install edgy
2007-01-03T09:06:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,SHUT IT ABOUT EDGY
2007-01-03T09:07:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,you will kiss my feet when you get it installed.
2007-01-03T09:09:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,you will.

2007-01-06T07:06:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,"cause this comp is crap, and i dont want to put a 50 gig into it, not worth it"
2007-01-06T07:06:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,"yeah, that's reasonable. im sure there are like 10gb or so drives on ebay that sell pretty cheap"
2007-01-06T07:07:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,"cause if so, i'll just get a 2 gig from best buy or circuit city and do that"
2007-01-06T07:07:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,"maybe, it sounds like it would work. ive never done it before"
2007-01-06T07:08:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,"seems like a good idea, i think i found a flash drive install link on digg, maybe i'll write an article on it..."

2007-01-10T06:50:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,"i dunno, about to scrap this comp, and get a recycle from my school"
2007-01-10T06:50:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,might do well
2007-01-10T06:51:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,"i dunno, i wanna get off of ebay, but kinda dont trust some of the stuff, and the places up here want an arm and leg for 40 gig"
2007-01-10T06:52:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,"i keep getting the mount error on 'block (1,0), wtf does that mean"
2007-01-10T06:53:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,is this the same drive?

2007-01-10T07:11:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,i guess the windows install doesnt check the disk for problems
2007-01-10T07:11:00.000Z,tirus89,h3xis,"hmmm, anyway to bypass that in ubuntu?"
2007-01-10T07:11:00.000Z,h3xis,tirus89,not that i know of
