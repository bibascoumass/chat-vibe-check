2004-11-02T13:27:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"modconf is broken, but in universe."

2004-11-02T13:30:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"no, how do you know it isn't working?"
2004-11-02T13:31:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,what driver does it use?
2004-11-02T13:31:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,ubuntu is going to be the first distro to detech it
2004-11-02T13:31:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,wirod one that i can remember is i cound use modconf
2004-11-02T13:35:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"dude, he's using ubuntu"
2004-11-02T13:35:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,there is no newer version to use
2004-11-02T13:36:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,ubuntu uses d-i
2004-11-02T13:36:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"yes, I know that, but how does it help? he can't switch to a 'newer version of d-i', since there isn't one."
2004-11-02T13:37:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,i know but #debian-boot said there is a way of fixing it but its a lot harder than just reinatlling using kernel 2.6 which was in a later d-i
2004-11-02T13:38:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,he's using 2.6
2004-11-02T13:46:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"chill out, please."
2004-11-02T13:48:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"if you can't be helpful, please be quiet."
2004-11-03T06:06:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,why did you manually edit /etc/hosts to begin with?
2004-11-03T06:06:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,i did as they told me here
2004-11-03T06:06:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,no you didn't
2004-11-03T06:06:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,why did you edit it at all?
2004-11-03T06:09:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,i installed using expert (because a package wound always crash the installer/my cd drive... in other word i burn to cd to fast and it croupted)
2004-11-03T06:09:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,and expert didn't give you a /etc/hosts?
2004-11-03T06:09:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,are you sure the CD was burnt ok?
2004-11-03T06:09:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,i think it was Treenaks which was helping me to try and get gnome to start for the first time
2004-11-03T06:10:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,the cd md5sum is diffrent to the iso image
2004-11-03T06:10:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,then that is a very serious problem.
2004-11-03T06:10:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,did you try burning it again and reinstalling?
2004-11-03T06:11:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,i dont have another cd
2004-11-03T06:11:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,blank cds do not cost $1 each
2004-11-03T06:11:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,they do from the closest store open here
2004-11-03T06:11:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"dude, why didn't you mention this the other night?"
2004-11-03T06:12:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,why? it is working now
2004-11-03T06:12:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"no it's not, your /etc/hosts is broken"
2004-11-03T06:12:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,is this the cd you installed off that gave you a gnome that wouldn't start?
2004-11-03T06:13:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,the cd wound crash my cd drive each time it wound get to a persific package
2004-11-03T06:16:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,127.0.0.1       blerg.ertius.org        localhost       blerg
2004-11-03T06:16:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,make your /etc/hosts look like that
2004-11-03T06:16:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,i will /exec -o cat /etc/hosts for ya
2004-11-03T06:16:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"and in future, please, please, please mention critical things like 'the cd I'm installing from is corrupt' when complaining about things not working."
2004-11-03T06:17:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"no, I don't care what your hosts file looks like"
2004-11-03T06:17:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,just make yours look like mine
2004-11-03T06:19:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,burn it at a lower speed and make sure you check the md5sum *immediately*
2004-11-03T06:26:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,are you running a 2.6 kernel at the moment?
2004-11-03T06:26:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,yes
2004-11-03T06:27:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,don't use scanbus then
2004-11-03T06:28:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"no, say dev=/dev/hdc or whatever your disk is"
2004-11-03T06:28:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,cdrecord.
2004-11-03T06:32:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,what cdre... comand do i use?
2004-11-03T06:33:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,how did you burn the last CD?
2004-11-03T06:34:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,can you add to the faq an howto change your console rez?
2004-11-03T06:34:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"I don't know how to do that, I just use X."
2004-11-03T06:34:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,cdrecord dev=/dev/hdc speed=4 warty.iso
2004-11-03T06:35:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,where /dev/hdc is the device file for your cd burner.
2004-11-03T06:35:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,so many people ask the same question someone need to add it and i cant spell
2004-11-03T06:36:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,what is speed 4? 4x 0_0?
2004-11-03T06:36:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"yes, 4."
2004-11-03T06:36:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,no
2004-11-03T06:37:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"just do 4 or 8, please? apparently your burner has problemss, a lower speed makes it less likely you'll make another useless disk."
2004-11-03T06:37:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,why my cd support 42X and my cd burner supports 52X
2004-11-03T06:37:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,i have a CRAP cds
2004-11-03T06:38:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"exactly, use 4 or 8."
2004-11-03T06:39:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"for fuck's sake, use 8."
2004-11-03T06:43:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,i did
2004-11-03T06:45:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,you really don't need 20GB of swap.
2004-11-03T06:46:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,i know but heh
2004-11-03T06:49:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,that won't help.
2004-11-03T06:51:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"please stop, you're just confusing the issue."
2004-11-03T07:01:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,it's about 15 characters of output
2004-11-03T06:55:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,dude.
2004-11-03T06:56:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,why do you keep ignoring the solutions people give you?
2004-11-03T06:56:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,and i used it
2004-11-03T06:56:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,what does 'uname -r' print out?
2004-11-03T06:56:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,and it cdp... is using the wrong write modde
2004-11-03T06:57:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,'cdp'?
2004-11-03T06:57:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,'cdpa'?
2004-11-03T06:57:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"I don't understand all the abberviations you use, can you just use normal english please?"
2004-11-03T06:58:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,why are you using cdparanoia at all?
2004-11-03T06:59:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,lsmod | grep ide-scsi
2004-11-03T06:59:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,what does that print out?
2004-11-03T06:59:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,no
2004-11-03T07:00:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,it will be one line of output
2004-11-03T07:01:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,i am /exec -o in #flood
2004-11-03T07:02:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,then why cant i /exec -o here it????
2004-11-03T07:03:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,just type it in
2004-11-03T07:03:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,what??
2004-11-03T07:03:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"and as Treenaks says, it would be nice if you could use full sentences to make yourself easier to understand...it saves the whole back and forth thing"
2004-11-03T07:04:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,#flood
2004-11-03T07:06:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,i am doing it in #flood but nothing shows
2004-11-03T07:06:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,ok.  how about 'lsmod | grep ide-cd'?
2004-11-03T07:07:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,just run both those commands in a terminal
2004-11-03T07:08:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,why do you think that?
2004-11-03T07:10:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"you had everything starting up great, then hanging after a couple of hours?"
2004-11-03T07:11:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,when i had dail up using manbrake each time i got disconnect x dies with in a few clicks
2004-11-03T07:19:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,please stop it
2004-11-03T07:20:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,you're not helping
2004-11-04T11:42:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,you've never used windows?  how did you use dialup AOL then?
2004-11-04T11:43:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,google > dail up to aol + linux
2004-11-04T11:43:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"yes, linspire have supported it for a few months now"
2004-11-04T11:43:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,but you implied you used it years ago
2004-11-04T11:44:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,i used it 1 month ago for 30min
2004-11-04T11:44:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,i said i used it 1 month ago for 30min
2004-11-04T11:47:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,this seems fairly off-topic
2004-11-04T11:51:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,i am having problem with my burner
2004-11-04T11:53:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,does your burner actually work at all?
2004-11-04T11:53:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,in manbrake it did
2004-11-04T11:54:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,burn ubuntu from inside mandrake then
2004-11-04T11:55:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,no one can possibly help you debug such a broken system.
2004-11-04T11:57:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,i am going to have reinstall manbrake
2004-11-04T11:57:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"ok, see you later."
2004-11-04T11:58:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"cool, see you then"
2004-11-04T11:58:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,go reinstall it now.
2004-11-04T12:01:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,that's not the point
2004-11-04T12:01:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,19.5GB of swap is a complete waste
2004-11-04T12:02:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,just make a 10GB / and a 150GB /gome
2004-11-04T12:04:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,then don't put it there
2004-11-04T12:04:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,so put it in /home like a normal person
2004-11-04T12:05:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,do you put gobal source like the kernel source somewhere else than /usr/src?
2004-11-04T12:05:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,of course
2004-11-04T12:05:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,~/tmp
2004-11-04T12:06:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,why are you wasting your time splitting up into multiple partitions?
2004-11-04T12:06:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"obviously your data isn't *that* important, or you would't be formatting it"
2004-11-04T12:07:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,i never format my /home
2004-11-04T12:07:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,why don't you just go do this now instead of wasting time discussing it?
2004-11-04T12:08:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,sure!
2004-11-04T12:09:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,yes!
2004-11-04T12:10:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,stop being annoying to everyone
2004-11-04T12:10:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"if you want to format /home, do so"
2004-11-04T12:11:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"just burn the cd.  if you can't figure it out in ubuntu, use mandrake."
2004-11-04T12:11:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,bye!
2004-11-04T12:12:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,stop it.
2004-11-04T16:02:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,hey
2004-11-04T16:10:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"to the development branch, yes.,"
2004-11-04T16:10:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,what are you talking about?
2004-11-04T16:31:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,gaim 1.0.0 might have a sercity whole does that make it capble of a new binary?
2004-11-04T16:31:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"yes, security flaws could be eligible for security fixes"
2004-11-04T16:31:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"no, firefox 1.0 will never go into warty"
2004-11-04T16:31:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"if security issues are found, the fixes will be backported to the version of firefox in warty"
2004-11-04T16:31:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,it will NEVER be in warty
2004-11-04T16:31:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,there are some margor bugs in firefox
2004-11-04T16:31:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,you've reported these bugs?
2004-11-04T16:32:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,yes 3 of those bugs are mine
2004-11-04T16:32:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"well, firefox was downgraded to avoid a bunch of serious bugs in 0.10"
2004-11-04T16:32:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,spelling
2004-11-04T16:32:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,you cannot ever criticse people about spelling
2004-11-04T16:32:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,please stop talking until you know more about how Debian or Ubuntu work
2004-11-04T16:32:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"hoary will be updated daily, just as Debian sid is"
2004-11-04T16:32:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,warty is frozen just like Debian stable releases
2004-11-04T16:32:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,why?
2004-11-04T16:32:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"if you really want one, you can certainly run it"
2004-11-04T16:33:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,hopefully bugs like that won't make it into a stable release
2004-11-04T16:33:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"as much as you want to argue, this is how it is, and I trust the ubuntu folks to know more about RM than you, sorry"
2004-11-04T16:34:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,just chill and watch what happens
2004-11-04T16:34:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,"people want a newer version of a program but dont want margor bugs like that, thats why a testing branch is perfic for them"
2004-11-04T06:20:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,why don't you just try things instead of endlessly discussing them?
2004-11-04T06:21:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,i said i want to know what hdd to put in
2004-11-04T06:21:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,boot and see how much the base is
2004-11-04T06:22:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,i am still building the computer i want to know with which hdd i should build it with
2004-11-04T06:24:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,because ubuntu's base system has a whole lot more functionailty than Debian's
2004-11-04T06:25:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,so install and apt-get remove vim after i install?
2004-11-04T06:25:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,whatever you want
2004-11-04T06:34:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,but atlest phpbb2 is something

2004-11-04T08:59:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"no, you're making things up and claiming they are true."
2004-11-04T08:59:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,the difference between reality and fabrication is important.
2004-11-04T09:13:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,the release schedule is on the wiki
2004-11-04T09:14:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,and in the faq

2004-11-04T09:22:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,choose a password you don't care about
2004-11-04T09:22:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"the machine admins can see it if they really cared to, but a) they don't, b) they don't and c) you're paranoid"
2004-11-04T09:22:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,did you know lilo can see your nickserv password?
2004-11-04T09:23:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,and the google people can see  your gmail password!
2004-11-04T09:24:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,that sentence makes no sense
2004-11-04T09:24:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,d/m
2004-11-04T09:24:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"'d/m' is not a word, either."
2004-11-04T09:25:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"nobody will try to hijack your wiki account, it's utterly worthless.  if you make enemies, it's because of your behaviour, which you can fix."
2004-11-04T09:25:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,no i a woriod they are going to hijack something else more importaint
2004-11-04T09:26:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,then use a worthless password
2004-11-04T09:26:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,and I promise the admins don't know or care about you
2004-11-04T09:27:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"there can be, read the wiki"
2004-11-04T09:27:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,good.
2004-11-04T11:16:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,see why we need a bot?
2004-11-05T08:35:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,why did you unsplit the packaqges?
2004-11-05T08:36:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,i wanted to make xchat and xchat-text into one package
2004-11-05T08:37:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,xchat-text is unusable
2004-11-05T08:37:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,so why don't you disable the build of it then?
2004-11-05T08:38:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,install xchat-text and you will see what i mean
2004-11-05T08:39:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,so why don't you just disable the build?
2004-11-05T08:41:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"it has nothing to do with xchat, I'm just wondering why you don't disable the build entirely if you don't want it"
2004-11-05T08:41:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,because xchat need xchat-text for some reason even thou it doesnt use it
2004-11-05T08:42:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,it doesn't use it? at all? are you sure?
2004-11-05T08:42:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,ask #xchat why does xchat-common enclude xchat-text
2004-11-05T08:42:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"erm, that has nothing to do with xchat's authors"
2004-11-05T08:54:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,because they're sample scripts?
2004-11-05T08:55:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,excaly
2004-11-05T08:56:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,but the same script is used in xchat to give you the ignore feature
2004-11-05T08:56:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,yet it works without the script being moved.
2004-11-05T08:56:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,it's almost as if it's built-in
2004-11-05T08:58:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,excaly what i was tring to say but coundnt because i can make seence
2004-11-05T08:58:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,'can't'.
2004-11-05T08:59:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,do you see?
2004-11-05T09:02:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,can you please stop making incorrect assertions about things you don't understand?
2004-11-05T09:03:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,xchat uses xchat-text's source
2004-11-05T09:05:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,chill out
2004-11-05T09:05:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,stupid caps lock
2004-11-05T09:16:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,please don't bug them about Debian packaging
2004-11-05T09:16:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,they have nothing to do with it
2004-11-05T09:17:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,i am not in #xchat
2004-11-05T09:30:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,anywhere i can host them?
2004-11-05T09:30:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,the free webspace your isp gave you?
2004-11-05T09:32:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,good idea
2004-11-05T09:32:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,it 60MB they let me go over and unlimmited bw
2004-11-05T09:49:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"erm, why aren't you using debhelper?"
2004-11-05T09:50:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,what is debhelper?
2004-11-05T09:51:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,xchat and firefox are already packaged
2004-11-05T09:58:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,nope
2004-11-05T09:58:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,good
2004-11-05T09:58:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,want to test xchat for me?
2004-11-05T09:58:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,why didn't you just us the debian xchat packages?
2004-11-05T10:26:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,why aren't you using the debian source package?
2004-11-05T10:28:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,i am
2004-11-05T10:28:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,what do you think i am doing?
2004-11-05T10:28:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,so how can you possibly have the build-deps wrong?
2004-11-05T10:28:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,they're correct in Debian
2004-11-05T10:29:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,because xchat relies on xchat-common 2.4.0-0.2 and i renamed xchat-common 2.4.0-0.2ubuntu
2004-11-05T10:32:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,time to use your debugging skills
2004-11-05T10:32:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,what? a not a pr0 yet
2004-11-05T10:37:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,dpkg-deb was not the recommended way to build debs in woody
2004-11-05T10:37:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,or potato
2004-11-05T10:38:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,the guide is broken

2004-11-05T11:06:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"if you want to sit in on that, you must remain silent"
2004-11-05T11:09:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"regardless, remain silent"
2004-11-05T11:11:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,just shut up

2004-11-08T08:19:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"so you took someone else's package, instead of starting from scratch?"

2004-11-03T06:09:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,i think it was Treenaks which was helping me to try and get gnome to start for the first time

2004-11-03T06:37:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"just do 4 or 8, please? apparently your burner has problemss, a lower speed makes it less likely you'll make another useless disk."

2004-11-03T06:58:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,why are you using cdparanoia at all?
2004-11-03T06:59:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,lsmod | grep ide-scsi
2004-11-03T06:59:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,what does that print out?
2004-11-03T06:59:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,no
2004-11-03T07:00:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,it will be one line of output
2004-11-03T07:01:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,i am /exec -o in #flood
2004-11-03T07:02:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,then why cant i /exec -o here it????
2004-11-03T07:03:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,just type it in
2004-11-03T07:03:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,what??
2004-11-03T07:03:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"and as Treenaks says, it would be nice if you could use full sentences to make yourself easier to understand...it saves the whole back and forth thing"
2004-11-03T07:04:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,#flood
2004-11-03T07:06:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,i am doing it in #flood but nothing shows
2004-11-03T07:06:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,ok.  how about 'lsmod | grep ide-cd'?
2004-11-03T07:07:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,just run both those commands in a terminal
2004-11-03T07:08:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,why do you think that?
2004-11-03T07:10:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"you had everything starting up great, then hanging after a couple of hours?"
2004-11-03T07:11:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,when i had dail up using manbrake each time i got disconnect x dies with in a few clicks
2004-11-03T07:19:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,please stop it
2004-11-03T07:20:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,you're not helping
2004-11-04T11:42:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,you've never used windows?  how did you use dialup AOL then?
2004-11-04T11:43:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,google > dail up to aol + linux
2004-11-04T11:43:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"yes, linspire have supported it for a few months now"
2004-11-04T11:43:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,but you implied you used it years ago
2004-11-04T11:44:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,i used it 1 month ago for 30min
2004-11-04T11:44:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,i said i used it 1 month ago for 30min
2004-11-04T11:47:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,this seems fairly off-topic
2004-11-04T11:51:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,i am having problem with my burner
2004-11-04T11:53:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,does your burner actually work at all?
2004-11-04T11:53:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,in manbrake it did
2004-11-04T11:54:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,burn ubuntu from inside mandrake then
2004-11-04T11:55:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,no one can possibly help you debug such a broken system.
2004-11-04T11:57:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,i am going to have reinstall manbrake
2004-11-04T11:57:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"ok, see you later."
2004-11-04T11:58:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"cool, see you then"
2004-11-04T11:58:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,go reinstall it now.
2004-11-04T12:01:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,that's not the point
2004-11-04T12:01:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,19.5GB of swap is a complete waste
2004-11-04T12:02:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,just make a 10GB / and a 150GB /gome
2004-11-04T12:04:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,then don't put it there
2004-11-04T12:04:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,so put it in /home like a normal person
2004-11-04T12:05:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,do you put gobal source like the kernel source somewhere else than /usr/src?
2004-11-04T12:05:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,of course
2004-11-04T12:05:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,~/tmp
2004-11-04T12:06:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,why are you wasting your time splitting up into multiple partitions?
2004-11-04T12:06:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"obviously your data isn't *that* important, or you would't be formatting it"
2004-11-04T12:07:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,i never format my /home
2004-11-04T12:07:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,why don't you just go do this now instead of wasting time discussing it?
2004-11-04T12:08:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,sure!
2004-11-04T12:09:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,yes!
2004-11-04T12:10:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,stop being annoying to everyone
2004-11-04T12:10:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"if you want to format /home, do so"
2004-11-04T12:11:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"just burn the cd.  if you can't figure it out in ubuntu, use mandrake."
2004-11-04T12:11:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,bye!
2004-11-04T12:12:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,stop it.
2004-11-04T16:02:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,hey
2004-11-04T16:10:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"to the development branch, yes.,"
2004-11-04T16:10:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,what are you talking about?
2004-11-04T16:31:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,gaim 1.0.0 might have a sercity whole does that make it capble of a new binary?
2004-11-04T16:31:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"yes, security flaws could be eligible for security fixes"
2004-11-04T16:31:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"no, firefox 1.0 will never go into warty"
2004-11-04T16:31:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"if security issues are found, the fixes will be backported to the version of firefox in warty"
2004-11-04T16:31:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,it will NEVER be in warty
2004-11-04T16:31:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,there are some margor bugs in firefox
2004-11-04T16:31:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,you've reported these bugs?
2004-11-04T16:32:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,yes 3 of those bugs are mine
2004-11-04T16:32:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"well, firefox was downgraded to avoid a bunch of serious bugs in 0.10"
2004-11-04T16:32:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,spelling
2004-11-04T16:32:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,you cannot ever criticse people about spelling
2004-11-04T16:32:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,please stop talking until you know more about how Debian or Ubuntu work
2004-11-04T16:32:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"hoary will be updated daily, just as Debian sid is"
2004-11-04T16:32:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,warty is frozen just like Debian stable releases
2004-11-04T16:32:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,why?
2004-11-04T16:32:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"if you really want one, you can certainly run it"
2004-11-04T16:33:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,hopefully bugs like that won't make it into a stable release
2004-11-04T16:33:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"as much as you want to argue, this is how it is, and I trust the ubuntu folks to know more about RM than you, sorry"
2004-11-04T16:34:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,just chill and watch what happens
2004-11-04T16:34:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,"people want a newer version of a program but dont want margor bugs like that, thats why a testing branch is perfic for them"
2004-11-04T06:20:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,why don't you just try things instead of endlessly discussing them?
2004-11-04T06:21:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,i said i want to know what hdd to put in
2004-11-04T06:21:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,boot and see how much the base is
2004-11-04T06:22:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,i am still building the computer i want to know with which hdd i should build it with
2004-11-04T06:24:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,because ubuntu's base system has a whole lot more functionailty than Debian's
2004-11-04T06:25:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,so install and apt-get remove vim after i install?
2004-11-04T06:25:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,whatever you want
2004-11-04T06:34:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,but atlest phpbb2 is something
2004-11-04T07:50:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,no we don't
2004-11-04T07:51:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,we need one like dpkg
2004-11-04T07:51:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"no, wedon't"
2004-11-04T07:51:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,because then it will get full of crap like dpkg
2004-11-04T07:52:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,a link bot that pastes links
2004-11-04T07:52:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,that's even worse
2004-11-04T07:54:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"chill out, it hasn't been updated"
2004-11-04T07:54:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,it's known
2004-11-04T07:57:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,'shiting'?
2004-11-04T07:57:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,it hasn't been decided.
2004-11-04T07:57:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"I know, but it makes talking to you very hard"
2004-11-04T07:58:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,i cant wait till virc is starting to be more common
2004-11-04T08:08:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,so the meeting is on monday

2004-11-04T08:31:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,i am not trolling i wanted to know why people like it
2004-11-04T08:32:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,it's off-topic and trollish.
2004-11-04T08:32:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,thank you
2004-11-04T08:39:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,please stop making uninformed comments on everything
2004-11-04T08:57:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,it was bought by m$
2004-11-04T08:57:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,what was bought by MS?
2004-11-04T08:58:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,can you please stop making definitive claims about things you don't anything about?
2004-11-04T08:59:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"no, you're making things up and claiming they are true."
2004-11-04T08:59:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,the difference between reality and fabrication is important.
2004-11-04T09:13:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,the release schedule is on the wiki
2004-11-04T09:14:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,and in the faq
2004-11-04T09:14:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,yes.
2004-11-04T09:15:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"um, do you really need to plan the exact day of a release 2 years in the future?"
2004-11-04T09:17:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,yes i installed SuSE on someone computer which didnt even know howto use winblows and never read a howto use linux. and planing to upgrade him by the time i think he is read to goto a normal distro
2004-11-04T09:18:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,er...how does knowing when 'gnome 5.8' will be out help wit hthat?
2004-11-04T09:20:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,d/m

2004-11-04T09:21:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,you cant see your own?
2004-11-04T09:22:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,choose a password you don't care about
2004-11-04T09:22:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"the machine admins can see it if they really cared to, but a) they don't, b) they don't and c) you're paranoid"
2004-11-04T09:22:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,did you know lilo can see your nickserv password?
2004-11-04T09:23:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,and the google people can see  your gmail password!
2004-11-04T09:24:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,that sentence makes no sense
2004-11-04T09:24:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,d/m
2004-11-04T09:24:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"'d/m' is not a word, either."
2004-11-04T09:25:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"nobody will try to hijack your wiki account, it's utterly worthless.  if you make enemies, it's because of your behaviour, which you can fix."
2004-11-04T09:25:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,no i a woriod they are going to hijack something else more importaint
2004-11-04T09:26:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,then use a worthless password
2004-11-04T09:26:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,and I promise the admins don't know or care about you
2004-11-04T09:27:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"there can be, read the wiki"
2004-11-04T09:27:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,good.
2004-11-04T11:16:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,see why we need a bot?
2004-11-05T08:35:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,why did you unsplit the packaqges?
2004-11-05T08:36:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,i wanted to make xchat and xchat-text into one package
2004-11-05T08:37:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,xchat-text is unusable
2004-11-05T08:37:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,so why don't you disable the build of it then?
2004-11-05T08:38:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,install xchat-text and you will see what i mean
2004-11-05T08:39:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,so why don't you just disable the build?
2004-11-05T08:41:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"it has nothing to do with xchat, I'm just wondering why you don't disable the build entirely if you don't want it"
2004-11-05T08:41:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,because xchat need xchat-text for some reason even thou it doesnt use it
2004-11-05T08:42:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,it doesn't use it? at all? are you sure?
2004-11-05T08:42:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,ask #xchat why does xchat-common enclude xchat-text
2004-11-05T08:42:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"erm, that has nothing to do with xchat's authors"
2004-11-05T08:54:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,because they're sample scripts?
2004-11-05T08:55:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,excaly
2004-11-05T08:56:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,but the same script is used in xchat to give you the ignore feature
2004-11-05T08:56:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,yet it works without the script being moved.
2004-11-05T08:56:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,it's almost as if it's built-in
2004-11-05T08:58:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,excaly what i was tring to say but coundnt because i can make seence
2004-11-05T08:58:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,'can't'.
2004-11-05T08:59:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,do you see?
2004-11-05T09:02:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,can you please stop making incorrect assertions about things you don't understand?
2004-11-05T09:03:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,xchat uses xchat-text's source
2004-11-05T09:05:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,chill out
2004-11-05T09:05:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,stupid caps lock
2004-11-05T09:16:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,please don't bug them about Debian packaging
2004-11-05T09:16:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,they have nothing to do with it
2004-11-05T09:17:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,i am not in #xchat
2004-11-05T09:30:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,anywhere i can host them?
2004-11-05T09:30:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,the free webspace your isp gave you?
2004-11-05T09:32:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,good idea
2004-11-05T09:32:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,it 60MB they let me go over and unlimmited bw
2004-11-05T09:49:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,"erm, why aren't you using debhelper?"
2004-11-05T09:50:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,what is debhelper?
2004-11-05T09:51:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,xchat and firefox are already packaged
2004-11-05T09:58:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,nope
2004-11-05T09:58:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,good
2004-11-05T09:58:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,want to test xchat for me?
2004-11-05T09:58:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,why didn't you just us the debian xchat packages?
2004-11-05T10:26:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,why aren't you using the debian source package?
2004-11-05T10:28:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,i am
2004-11-05T10:28:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,what do you think i am doing?
2004-11-05T10:28:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,so how can you possibly have the build-deps wrong?
2004-11-05T10:28:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,they're correct in Debian
2004-11-05T10:29:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,because xchat relies on xchat-common 2.4.0-0.2 and i renamed xchat-common 2.4.0-0.2ubuntu
2004-11-05T10:32:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,time to use your debugging skills
2004-11-05T10:32:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,what? a not a pr0 yet
2004-11-05T10:37:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,dpkg-deb was not the recommended way to build debs in woody
2004-11-05T10:37:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,or potato
2004-11-05T10:38:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,the guide is broken
2004-11-05T10:38:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,http://www.nl.debian.org/doc/maint-guide/
2004-11-05T10:54:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,it's not that easy
2004-11-05T10:54:00.000Z,bob2,Gmail,what were the names of some of the 100 programs you packaged?
2004-11-05T10:56:00.000Z,Gmail,bob2,zmanimim qtzmanim gtkzmanim about 30 version of each
