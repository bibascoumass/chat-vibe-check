2008-12-11T08:59:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,try  aptitude why glib (ect)
2008-12-14T05:30:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,for one thing.. you have a typo.. you're first quote was a 'single' quote... you want both quotes to be double quotes
2008-12-14T05:38:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres, export PKG_CONFIG_PATH='/usr/PKG_CONFIG'   is the way to do that properly.. just an fyi
2008-12-14T05:39:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,then to check that you have done it properly do...   echo '$PKG_CONFIG_PATH'
2008-12-14T05:40:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,not in here tho.. on the command line
2008-12-14T05:40:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,duh? lol
2008-12-14T05:40:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres, export PKG_CONFIG_PATH='/usr/PKG_CONFIG'   -CHECK YOUR QUOTES- is the way to do that properly.. just an fyi
2008-12-14T05:41:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,same thing
2008-12-14T05:45:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,it's the shell waiting for more input(after the single quote you had) because your quotes were wrong
2008-12-14T05:46:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,what are the right quotes then?
2008-12-14T05:46:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,export PKG_CONFIG_PATH='/usr/PKG_CONFIG'   echo '$PKG_CONFIG_PATH'   ...returns   /usr/PKG_CONFIG
2008-12-14T05:47:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,so type '        export PKG_CONFIG_PATH='/usr/PKG_CONFIG'         '            ?
2008-12-14T05:47:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,use double quotes in BOTH places
2008-12-14T05:47:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,yes

2008-12-14T05:48:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,"then check it, with   echo '$PKG_CONFIG_PATH'"
2008-12-14T05:48:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,ok.. there you go.. you got it now
2008-12-14T05:48:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,now?

2008-12-14T09:20:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,i don't know what's wrong on your system. compiled for me and raylu just fine.. on the first try. i don't know what to tell you.
2008-12-14T09:20:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,should i just install 8.4 regardless?
2008-12-14T09:21:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,"i cannot recommend one way or the other on that, because that's entirely up to you"
2008-12-14T09:22:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,8.10 is working great here.. did you upgrade frmo 8.4? is that how you got 8.10? an upgrade?
2008-12-17T08:23:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,hi!
2008-12-17T08:23:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,"i'm starting with a fresh install again. if netradiant doesn't work, i'll try it on arch"
2008-12-17T08:25:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,"oh... roger that? you know, one thing about the other day, is you cold have updated the source through svn. you never know, prhaps it was updated between the time you downloaded it, and the time that i downloaded it. but that probably wasn't the problem. but you never know!"
2008-12-17T08:25:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,you could be right ;)
2008-12-17T08:28:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,anyway.. i wish you better luck this time :)
2008-12-17T08:52:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,awesome! i was hoping badly that your reinstall wouldn't be in vein
2008-12-17T08:48:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,how's it going? having any luck?
2008-12-17T08:48:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,just got subversion installed

2008-12-17T08:52:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,i needed to anyway. :P but thanks :)
2008-12-17T08:52:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,"ok, cool :-)"
2008-12-17T09:11:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,it's the error that prevents me from changing views in the 2d viewport
2008-12-17T09:16:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,"sorry, what's happening?"
2008-12-17T09:17:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,"oh.. i see...  a Warning. usually you can ignore 'warnings', but sometimes they do mean something that needs paying attention too"
2008-12-17T09:17:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,can i msg you
2008-12-17T09:18:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,ok
2008-12-18T04:16:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,gtkradiant works perfect on 8.04
2008-12-18T04:17:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,"oh. roger. well, that's good at least. i forget, what happened after you successfully compiled it in 8.10 yesterday?"
2008-12-18T04:18:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,"it was missing gtk+ dependancies, ones that you can't possibly change, but are in 8.04."
2008-12-18T04:18:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,"oh yeah, now i remember"
2008-12-18T04:19:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,the missing gtk+ files made the change views inopprable.
2008-12-18T04:19:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,cool
2008-12-18T04:21:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,"anyway... you can run it in 8.04 for now so it's all good, correct? you know that probably considered an actual bug in the gtk libs available in 8.10 and you could file a bug report"
2008-12-18T05:00:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,do you have experience in fstab?
2008-12-18T05:00:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,"i'm a little rusty with it, but yes"

2008-12-18T05:01:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,you mean that partition is not formatted?
2008-12-18T05:01:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,it is my partition i use to store files between linux formats
2008-12-18T05:02:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,ok
2008-12-18T05:02:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,wil that work?
2008-12-18T05:02:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,you mean that partition is not formatted?
2008-12-18T05:02:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,"formatted? as in empty? no, it's near full of files."
2008-12-18T05:03:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,what does this mean.. will that mount.. without format?  without format????
2008-12-18T05:04:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,i don't want any files on there to be deleted. will the syntax 'UUID=B2284CC7284C8BF3 /media/windows/ ntfs-3g defaults 0 0' mount it?
2008-12-18T05:04:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,"yes, i believe it should"
2008-12-18T05:05:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,it says i am not privelaged to mount Storage disk
2008-12-18T05:06:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,are you trying as root user? if not. you will need to change the permissions in fstab to change who is allowed to mount it
2008-12-18T05:06:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,how do you set permissions in fstab?
2008-12-18T05:08:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,"this is where i am rusty... it's called a umask. it's something like...  defaults,umask=0022"
2008-12-18T05:09:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,umask=0022 doesn't work
2008-12-18T05:10:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,try  umask=022
2008-12-18T05:10:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,same
2008-12-18T05:11:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,i would need to google it.. doing so now
2008-12-18T05:12:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,try  umask=0222
2008-12-18T05:13:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,same result :(
2008-12-18T05:13:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,hmmm. ok. i'll do more searching
2008-12-18T05:13:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,"full syntax: 'UUID=B2284CC7284C8BF3 /media/windows/ ntfs-3g defaults,umask=0222 0 0'"
2008-12-18T05:14:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,"looks correct to me, but, ineed to read some more"
2008-12-18T05:17:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,222?
2008-12-18T05:18:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,i'll try reboot. i got to go anyway
2008-12-18T05:18:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,ok
2008-12-18T05:19:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,the problem may be with your mount point permissions
2008-12-18T05:22:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,what should i set mount point to?
2008-12-18T05:23:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,"ok, try this in fstab in    noauto,ro,umask=0222"
2008-12-18T05:23:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,then we will set the permissions for the mount point
2008-12-18T05:25:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,so to do that...  cd /media  chmod go+rx windows
2008-12-18T05:25:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,sorry.. i had that wrong
2008-12-18T05:25:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,so to do that...  cd /media  chmod go+wx windows
2008-12-18T08:12:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,"well, i've tried to work on it myself some, but have run into a big issue. you are wanting a regular use to be able to mount it, correct?"
2008-12-18T08:10:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,hello. i just got back how's it going?
2008-12-18T08:11:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,still messing with fstab. just got back too ;)
2008-12-18T08:12:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,yes?
2008-12-18T08:13:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,and you keep getting the message that only root can do that?
2008-12-18T08:13:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,should i force it?
2008-12-18T08:14:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,will it format/delete data if i force it?
2008-12-18T08:14:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,"the question is, are you trying to make it so a regular user can mount it? if yes, are you getting the message that only root can 'mount' it?"
2008-12-18T08:15:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,it doesn't say only root can. it just says my user doesn't have privelages
2008-12-18T08:16:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,http://img67.imageshack.us/my.php?image=screenshotpp6.png
2008-12-18T08:16:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,"oh, i see. i wouldn't think that using a force option would hurt it, but i'm not certain. i wonder if the regular user can even force the mount if they wanted to."
2008-12-18T08:17:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,then should i force it?
2008-12-18T08:18:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,"i get a blank page for that image link, just fyi"
2008-12-18T08:19:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,i can't really answer whether you should try to force it or not. that's entirely up to you
2008-12-18T08:19:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=2ev3xhg&s=5
2008-12-18T08:20:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,"ok, that one worked"
2008-12-18T08:25:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,are you getting only root can do that or you don't have privelages
2008-12-18T08:26:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,i'm getting that 'only root can do that'

2008-12-18T08:30:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,"ok, cool. i'll check it out. however, does fstab even matter if trying to mount it manually on the command line? i don't think it does"
2008-12-18T08:31:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,i did 'sudo chown keres:keres  -R /media/windows'
2008-12-18T08:39:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,is thera a risk with force?
2008-12-18T08:39:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,"i doubt it, but i'm not certain"
2008-12-18T09:04:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,so are you still trying?
2008-12-18T09:04:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,force worked
2008-12-18T09:04:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,"roger that, cool"

2008-12-18T09:06:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,nope.. haven't tried or done that yet
2008-12-18T09:06:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,and did you try 'sudo chown YOURUSER:YOURUSER media/windows'

2008-12-18T09:07:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,no. but i did get a longer one when i had all my UIDs and sdb1's commented out.
2008-12-18T09:08:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,i get that message whether the 'windows' dir is owned by root or regular user... strange that we are having different messages/responses
2008-12-18T09:09:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,why not just chown it?
2008-12-18T09:09:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,did you read what i said?
2008-12-18T09:09:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,i get that message whether the 'windows' dir is owned by root or regular user...
2008-12-18T09:09:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,that means i used 'chown'
2008-12-18T09:09:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,what does your fstab look like?

2008-12-11T08:59:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,try  aptitude why glib (ect)
2008-12-14T05:30:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,for one thing.. you have a typo.. you're first quote was a 'single' quote... you want both quotes to be double quotes
2008-12-14T05:38:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres, export PKG_CONFIG_PATH='/usr/PKG_CONFIG'   is the way to do that properly.. just an fyi
2008-12-14T05:39:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,then to check that you have done it properly do...   echo '$PKG_CONFIG_PATH'

2008-12-14T05:40:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,duh? lol
2008-12-14T05:40:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres, export PKG_CONFIG_PATH='/usr/PKG_CONFIG'   -CHECK YOUR QUOTES- is the way to do that properly.. just an fyi

2008-12-14T05:45:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,it's the shell waiting for more input(after the single quote you had) because your quotes were wrong
2008-12-14T05:46:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,what are the right quotes then?
2008-12-14T05:46:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,export PKG_CONFIG_PATH='/usr/PKG_CONFIG'   echo '$PKG_CONFIG_PATH'   ...returns   /usr/PKG_CONFIG

2008-12-18T05:01:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,you mean that partition is not formatted?

2008-12-18T05:04:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,i don't want any files on there to be deleted. will the syntax 'UUID=B2284CC7284C8BF3 /media/windows/ ntfs-3g defaults 0 0' mount it?

2008-12-18T05:05:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,it says i am not privelaged to mount Storage disk
2008-12-18T05:06:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,are you trying as root user? if not. you will need to change the permissions in fstab to change who is allowed to mount it
2008-12-18T05:06:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,how do you set permissions in fstab?
2008-12-18T05:08:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,"this is where i am rusty... it's called a umask. it's something like...  defaults,umask=0022"

2008-12-18T05:11:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,i would need to google it.. doing so now

2008-12-18T05:18:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,ok
2008-12-18T05:19:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,the problem may be with your mount point permissions
2008-12-18T05:22:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,what should i set mount point to?
2008-12-18T05:23:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,"ok, try this in fstab in    noauto,ro,umask=0222"
2008-12-18T05:23:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,then we will set the permissions for the mount point
2008-12-18T05:25:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,so to do that...  cd /media  chmod go+rx windows
2008-12-18T05:25:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,sorry.. i had that wrong
2008-12-18T05:25:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,so to do that...  cd /media  chmod go+wx windows
2008-12-18T08:12:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,"well, i've tried to work on it myself some, but have run into a big issue. you are wanting a regular use to be able to mount it, correct?"
2008-12-18T08:10:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,hello. i just got back how's it going?
2008-12-18T08:11:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,still messing with fstab. just got back too ;)
2008-12-18T08:12:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,yes?
2008-12-18T08:13:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,and you keep getting the message that only root can do that?
2008-12-18T08:13:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,should i force it?
2008-12-18T08:14:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,will it format/delete data if i force it?
2008-12-18T08:14:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,"the question is, are you trying to make it so a regular user can mount it? if yes, are you getting the message that only root can 'mount' it?"
2008-12-18T08:15:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,it doesn't say only root can. it just says my user doesn't have privelages

2008-12-18T08:16:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,"oh, i see. i wouldn't think that using a force option would hurt it, but i'm not certain. i wonder if the regular user can even force the mount if they wanted to."
2008-12-18T08:17:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,then should i force it?
2008-12-18T08:18:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,"i get a blank page for that image link, just fyi"
2008-12-18T08:19:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,i can't really answer whether you should try to force it or not. that's entirely up to you

2008-12-18T08:31:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,i did 'sudo chown keres:keres  -R /media/windows'
2008-12-18T08:39:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,is thera a risk with force?

2009-01-01T08:23:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,"so, you still waiting on a good working version of radiant?"
2009-01-01T08:23:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,already got one :) working in it right now
2009-01-01T08:24:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,oh! cool :-) what name and version? or what did you have to do?
2009-01-01T08:25:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,"it's the default gtk1.5 release. the problem was scons builds the debug version by default, so someone told me to do scons build='release'"
2009-01-01T08:26:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,"oh, i see. seems i have heard of scons, but i forget what it is. - ok, just looked it up, replacement for 'make'"
2009-01-01T08:26:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,a sloppy one ;)
2009-01-01T08:27:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,oh
2009-01-01T08:27:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,so are you making maps now?
2009-01-01T08:27:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,"well, it's just not as easy as make"
2009-01-01T08:27:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,yes
2009-01-01T08:27:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,http://keres.satgnu.net/maps/index.html
2009-01-01T08:27:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,"ok, looking now"
2009-01-01T08:29:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,"hey, looks great! lot of people still play that? quake2 is a fairly old version isn't it?"
2009-01-01T08:30:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,"in fact, i can't believe how good that map looks if it's for quake2"
2009-01-01T08:30:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,quake2world is an in-developement q2-based game. it's got really good graphics
2009-01-01T08:30:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,"it has bump/normal maps, realtime lighitng"
2009-01-01T08:30:00.000Z,keres,onetinsoldier,really fast pased combat. it's like all good things quake combined.
2009-01-01T08:30:00.000Z,onetinsoldier,keres,"ah-ha! i see, well, very sweet looking"
