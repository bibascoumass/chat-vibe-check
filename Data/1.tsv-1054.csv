2004-09-04T08:42:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,done
2004-09-04T14:21:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"speaking of hate mail, we need to re-enable the hostname question in d-i"
2004-09-04T14:25:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"under all circumstances, I take it?"
2004-09-04T14:26:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,I would say so
2004-09-04T14:27:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,done
2004-09-04T14:27:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,I will accept responsibility for the additional question :-)
2004-09-05T16:39:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,what time were you planning to roll Sounder 7?
2004-09-05T16:59:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,you're free to statoverride /bin/mount and edit fstab
2004-09-05T05:01:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"if you need to start now, then do it.  it's more important to get sounder 7 out than to have usplash"
2004-09-05T05:18:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,that's a known bug in thom's acpid upload
2004-09-05T05:18:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,please do file a bug to remind him
2004-09-05T05:21:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"if you have time to do it, reverting ubuntu4 is fine with me"
2004-09-05T11:53:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,I believe the final scheme for the version number was with a dash (4-10)
2004-09-05T12:58:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"indeed. it's a Recommends: thing, fixed"
2004-09-05T13:07:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"actually, if we're going the archive-copier route we absolutely want this approach"
2004-09-05T13:08:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,archive-copier would handle base as well?
2004-09-05T13:10:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,does this include all of the shipseed additions we made in Oxford?
2004-09-05T13:10:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"that's all entirely automatic now, so yes"
2004-09-05T13:58:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,barking?
2004-09-05T14:15:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"archive-copier seems to do the right thing for me, as far as copying"
2004-09-05T14:23:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"apt-cdrom add, too"
2004-09-05T14:24:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"by the time I logged in on vt2 to look, /var/cache/apt/archives was empty"
2004-09-05T14:29:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"oh, damn, I forgot to mention that; you also need to boot with KEEP_DEBS=yes"
2004-09-05T14:34:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,apparently this happens when xresprobe can't
2004-09-05T14:34:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"yeah, I'm prodding it now.  but it was detecting my LCD OK in Oxford"
2004-09-05T14:42:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,this is the d-i-with-no-network case
2004-09-06T05:16:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,Applications->System Tools->Terminal?
2004-09-06T05:41:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,is more awake than I am
2004-09-06T07:44:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"working on upgrading our netcfg to be based on Debian 1.01, which has several fixes we want; hope that's ok"
2004-09-06T07:46:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"if you're ok, I'm ok"
2004-09-06T08:16:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"oh, forgot to mention...I did another round of sounder 7 testing using archive-copier and KEEP_DEBS=yes; seemed to work perfectly"
2004-09-06T08:20:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,kewl
2004-09-06T08:25:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"that iftab thing in netcfg could go upstream, couldn't it?"
2004-09-06T08:26:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,I assume so
2004-09-06T11:54:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,yes
2004-09-06T11:56:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,why is it named 'fortune-mod' anyway?
2004-09-06T11:56:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,I've often wondered that
2004-09-06T11:57:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"come to look, fortunes-min is actually pretty reasonable"
2004-09-06T12:03:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,quite likely
2004-09-06T12:04:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,s'what I thought
2004-09-07T09:06:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"ooh, we have a sorted daily now?"
2004-09-07T09:09:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,for a while ...
2004-09-07T09:09:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,I was wondering if sorting the directory inodes with the files they contain would help too - they're all at the start at the moment
2004-09-07T09:50:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,what would be a safe time of day to automatically rsync the current daily iso?
2004-09-07T10:07:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"the dailies are always finished by 8:45 UTC, and almost always finished by 7:30 UTC; I don't know what the two freak late ones were about"
2004-09-07T10:22:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,thanks
2004-09-07T10:38:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"with the sorted CD, it seems to do quite well on source packages with multiple binaries, but it still seems to seek every time it has to read a new directory"
2004-09-07T10:40:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"ok, sounds like I'll have to twiddle that a bit; I can probably sort directories with the .debs they contain relatively easily"
2004-09-07T09:27:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,fascinating...in #268421 the submitter pasted the entire status file entry as the debbugs pseudo-header
2004-09-07T09:28:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,cool
2004-09-07T10:37:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,console-data asked me a question on upgrade for some reason
2004-09-07T10:40:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,no idea; what does echo GET debconf/priority | debconf-communicate say?
2004-09-07T10:40:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"wasn't anything I changed anyway, I don't think"
2004-09-07T10:41:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,0 high
2004-09-11T10:11:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,did that make it onto your todo list?
2004-09-11T10:12:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,what do you think?
2004-09-11T10:12:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"yeah, I was thinking it was, but then, the last message is worded such that people don't generally read it"
2004-09-11T10:13:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"true, but that applies to most of the installer"
2004-09-11T10:14:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,easy to put a comment in /etc/sudoers about it ... power users can remove it
2004-09-11T12:13:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"so, am I doing the timestamp_timeout=0 thing or not? I'm about to upload base-config for another reason ..."
2004-09-11T12:13:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,it's OK with me if you and pitti agree
2004-09-11T12:14:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,it sounded like there was a consensus on #warthogs
2004-09-11T12:55:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,does Keybuk's laptop overheat itself during the install if we don't?
2004-09-11T13:10:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,can you send him an email and ask him about the ACPI stuff?
2004-09-12T06:04:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,absolutely not; I'd prefer it
2004-09-12T10:48:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,removing eth1394 from hw-detect now
2004-09-12T10:48:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"ok, I'll upload hotplug"
2004-09-13T06:11:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,why doesn't evolution1.5 install on its own?  was it missing when the CD was built or something?
2004-09-13T06:13:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,works for me; do you just mean the way aptitude won't install anything if one piece of the task is uninstallable?
2004-09-13T06:14:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"oh, so it's just fallout from the evolution-* uninstallability then?"
2004-09-13T06:14:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"well, when I do it using aptitude by hand then I get evolution1.5 installed, so I guess so"
2004-09-13T06:21:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"we can, but it makes the output awfully unreadable"
2004-09-13T06:23:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"they use the same method, which is the root of the issue I suppose"
2004-09-13T06:24:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"pkgSourceList::Describe, I believe"
2004-09-13T06:26:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"hmm, it actually does that explicitly"
2004-09-13T15:52:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"stopping adding /cdrom to fstab is non-trivially fiddly, because integration between d-i and base-config is involved there"
2004-09-13T13:12:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,?
2004-09-13T13:36:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"npmccallum: when I looked at the eject upload, it did not look like it depended on pmount. did I miss something?"
2004-09-13T13:39:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"yes, it is actually a bit higher level than mount"
2004-09-13T13:40:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,which version of eject is that from?
2004-09-13T13:40:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,2.0.13deb-6ubuntu1
2004-09-13T13:41:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,quite :-)
2004-09-13T13:44:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,no
2004-09-13T13:44:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"by 'fixing' do you mean moving the dependency to eject, or removing it altogether?"
2004-09-13T13:45:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,removing the dependency and having it fall back to standard umount
2004-09-13T13:45:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"ah, good"
2004-09-13T13:57:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,pitti: is the initial user added to plugdev?
2004-09-13T14:00:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"yes, it just occurred to me earlier today (after joeyh asked about it) that that might be why our /etc/default/gdm was ending up mode 0600"
2004-09-13T14:00:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,that was only filed as important(!)
2004-09-14T08:47:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,ip has had a man page for _ages_
2004-09-14T08:49:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,what's your opinion on the sbin question?
2004-09-14T08:54:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,mousedev is totally generic input layer goodness
2004-09-14T08:55:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,:-(
2004-09-14T08:56:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,there really should be a sane kernel-level way to handle this
2004-09-14T08:58:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"we could just compile in mousedev everywhere, too"
2004-09-14T08:58:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"why is it done that way on powerpc, anyway?"
2004-09-14T08:58:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,because you always want it? who knows
2004-09-14T09:00:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,thanks
2004-09-14T11:25:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,you're still awake?? or up early?
2004-09-14T06:00:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"don't think I was still awake by 6:25, but I was up depressingly late for no very good reason"
2004-09-14T11:05:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"today's daily worked, anyway"
2004-09-14T11:05:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"oh, good"
2004-09-14T15:21:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"custom-expert (name sucks, I know) is base-only and low priority, in case you ever need that"
2004-09-14T15:34:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,just trying an install with the current daily
2004-09-14T15:50:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,I think you're right that it's the directory ordering on the CD that's slowing things down
2004-09-14T15:54:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,what should we do about archive-copier vs. apt-cdrom?
2004-09-15T16:06:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,let me know when there's a CD up and I'll give it a try; I'm quite interested to see the difference
2004-09-15T16:11:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"Scots prefer the spelling whisky; Americans follow instead the Irish spelling, so Kentucky bourbon is whiskey."
2004-09-15T16:46:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"I know which is which, certainly :-)"
2004-09-15T16:46:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,I had been wondering whether to have Scotch or Irish
2004-09-15T16:46:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,ah :-)
2004-09-15T05:00:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,maybe
2004-09-15T05:03:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"yeah, that's what I meant"
2004-09-15T05:05:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,grub-installer is missing from the amd64 CD; is that intentional?
2004-09-15T05:07:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"that is, it's not on the CD at all"
2004-09-15T05:12:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,not in the archive
2004-09-15T05:18:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,bug filed
2004-09-16T10:39:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"that alone should not cause the script to fail, should it?  if it were set -e, then whichever command actually produced the nonzero $? would have terminated the script, no?"
2004-09-16T10:39:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,look more closely at bug #1019; the && means set -e doesn't trigger
2004-09-16T11:01:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,can we have a debian-installer component in bugzilla so that people stop assigning bugs to libdebian-installer?
2004-09-16T11:01:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,yes
2004-09-16T11:02:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,done
2004-09-17T15:12:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"so, what does the latest build failure look like?"
2004-09-17T11:39:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"file a bug about that 2>/dev/null, please"
2004-09-17T11:40:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,i386 kernel built fine; powerpc and amd64 weren't implemented until this morning
2004-09-17T11:57:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,so the current amd64 daily should be a good one?
2004-09-17T12:23:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,thanks for the d-i changes for the kernel
2004-09-17T13:12:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"yes, current amd64 daily should be ok ..."
2004-09-17T13:13:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"if you're uploading linux-source-2.6.8.1 again, I can hold the sounder release until we've got all the d-i ducks in a row for all architectures; shouldn't take too long to do the remaining two"
2004-09-17T13:30:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,I've uploaded it again
2004-09-17T13:30:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"it should build all of i386, amd64 and powerpc now"
2004-09-17T13:30:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"will wait for builds, then do l-k-di-*, then build other stuff, then ..."
2004-09-17T13:33:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,any clue?
2004-09-17T13:48:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"would be better now to wait for a new kernel-package to build and just rebuild with that, I think"
2004-09-17T14:45:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,what sort of base-installer support for amd64?
2004-09-17T14:48:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"should I test the current amd64 daily, or wait for the next one?"
2004-09-17T14:51:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,was that an explicit change from boot-floppies?
2004-09-17T14:51:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,pcmcia-cs isn't particularly related to boot-floppies?
2004-09-17T14:51:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"base-config maybe?  anyway, in woody, pcmcia-cs was removed on systems without pcmcia"
2004-09-17T14:52:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"oh, gotcha"
2004-09-17T14:57:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"great, so the next daily should be 2.6.8.1 across the board?"
2004-09-17T15:10:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"thom: regarding bugzilla, either of you want to file a wishlist bug to ask justdave about it?"
2004-09-17T15:18:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,do you have a new linux-kernel-di for powerpc ready for when the kernel itself is built?
2004-09-17T15:42:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"hmm, I didn't think udebs had init scripts"
2004-09-17T15:43:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,pcmcia is a special case
2004-09-17T15:43:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,is it the only such?
2004-09-17T15:43:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,the only one I know of
2004-09-18T07:09:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,he's gone :-/
2004-09-18T07:12:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,is it OK to update the seeds for 2.6.8.1?
2004-09-18T07:13:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"crap, forgot about that for amd64 :)"
2004-09-18T07:13:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"you do base, I'll do installer"
2004-09-18T07:14:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,amd64?  base doesnt' seem to have been updated for any arches
2004-09-18T07:14:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,base should only need doing for powerpc in fact ...
2004-09-18T07:14:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,base still says kernel-image-2.6-386
2004-09-18T07:14:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"base doesn't need it for i386/amd64, it uses the metapackages"
2004-09-18T07:14:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,... oh
2004-09-18T07:14:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"wrong metapackages, right"
2004-09-18T07:19:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,updated base and supported
2004-09-18T07:23:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,looked through all and extra; seems to be in order
2004-09-18T07:27:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,what's the location of your new germinate archive?
2004-09-18T07:34:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,does b-i have the smarts to select the tasty optimized kernel for all warty architectures?
2004-09-18T07:39:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,I talked to mark about it on the phone today
2004-09-18T07:41:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"BTW, I guessed that misdn wasn't needed in d-i, but might've been wrong"
2004-09-18T07:41:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"dunno, probably a question for doko"
2004-09-18T07:49:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,ipw2200
2004-09-18T08:06:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,going to make archive-copier the default for Sounder 8; it isn't going to get enough feedback otherwise
2004-09-18T09:20:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,sounds good
2004-09-18T09:26:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,why is bicyclerepair under 'Germinate workarounds' in DesktopSeed?
2004-09-18T09:27:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"misplaced, I suppose"
2004-09-18T09:38:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,I probably just wasn't paying attention to the different types of headings in the file when I added them
2004-09-18T09:41:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"if that applies to the version we ship, then yes, certainly"
2004-09-18T09:45:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,the changelog is convincing
2004-09-18T09:50:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"speaking of getting up, don't you need to sleep eventually so that you can do that too? :-)"
2004-09-18T09:20:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"if you wanted to remove pppoe, then pppoeconf will need to go too"
2004-09-18T09:21:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,it shouldn't
2004-09-18T09:28:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,is this a problem for the CD build?
2004-09-18T09:30:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,not too bothered
2004-09-18T10:03:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"let's see if we can put our heads together and come up with a strategy for it, and then it can go offline"
2004-09-18T10:03:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,ok
2004-09-18T10:15:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,I agree
2004-09-18T10:21:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,right
2004-09-18T10:25:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"well, I made an attempt to get firmware loading support going, but I doubt that it works"
2004-09-18T10:25:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"apart from the firmware issues, is there a wlanctl-ng udeb?"
2004-09-18T10:25:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,I can look at firmware support with you; I have hardware I can test with
2004-09-18T10:42:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"we may not even have anything outstanding from his list, but we'll see"
2004-09-18T10:49:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,I don't think that's a big deal myself
2004-09-18T10:54:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,ok
2004-09-18T10:56:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,what shall we do about a udeb for l-r-m?
2004-09-18T10:57:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,pick it apart in linux-kernel-di?
2004-09-18T10:58:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"that would produce essentially restricted udebs, but in main"
2004-09-18T10:58:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,I was thinking a separate kernel-wedge-using thing
2004-09-18T10:58:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"hmm, yes, that would mean linux-kernel-di would build-dep on the restricted modules, yuck"
2004-09-18T10:58:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"BTW, I do have another idea for cutting down the udeb problem; we can reunify linux-kernel-di-*"
2004-09-18T10:59:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"ooh, that sounds nice"
2004-09-18T10:59:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"it might run into apt limits though, I'm sure you're familiar with that problem ..."
2004-09-18T10:59:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"I think I bumped those limits high enough in current apt, but it's easy enough to bump them again if necessary"
2004-09-18T11:00:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"that's not the issue, think woody->warty upgrades ..."
2004-09-18T11:00:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,woody->warty upgrades require an apt pre-upgrade to work well anyway
2004-09-18T11:00:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,the point is it can get hard to even apt-get update
2004-09-18T11:01:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"we'll drown under that bridge when we come to it, I guess :-)"
2004-09-18T11:13:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,sure
2004-09-18T11:15:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,let's hold off until we've decided on the final list
2004-09-18T11:15:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,I'll just remove pppoe for this release then
2004-09-18T11:15:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,ok
2004-09-18T11:20:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,a quick update on the installer is the last item on my agenda
2004-09-18T11:23:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"in fact, if it's ok with you, I'd like to test a sounder 8 candidate before you bless it"
2004-09-18T11:23:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,sure
2004-09-18T11:25:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"is it just a matter of increasing the priority, or is it trickier than that?"
2004-09-18T11:25:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"resizing ext3 not working; may be a parted issue, haven't diagnosed it yet"
2004-09-18T11:25:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"increasing the priority would fix it, but may incur Mark's wrath at an additional question :-)"
2004-09-18T11:25:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"it would only be asked if it couldn't associate without one, no?"
2004-09-18T11:26:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"I think it's asked regardless, but wouldn't swear to it"
2004-09-18T11:28:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,is the question which devices should be added to fstab?
2004-09-18T11:29:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,yes
2004-09-18T12:14:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,ready to test when you are
2004-09-18T13:53:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,I was just thinking
2004-09-18T13:53:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,apt-cdrom essentially does 'find /cdrom/'
2004-09-18T13:53:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,maybe that could substitute for your explicit find
2004-09-18T14:01:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"probably not in cdrom-detect, since apt-cdrom isn't even close to installed yet ..."
2004-09-18T14:17:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"but yes, apt-cdrom would substitute for it in the case where you aren't using archive-copier; I didn't make any post-reboot changes along those lines"
2004-09-18T15:17:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,new daily is up
2004-09-19T16:36:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,eh?  it seems to do utf-8 by default
2004-09-19T16:42:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"I tried changing the locale in a new tab, but it doesn't seem to display Unicode characters correctly when I do that"
2004-09-19T16:43:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"hmm, I thought there was a profile setting for that, but I guess it sets it based on your locale when you start it"
2004-09-19T16:45:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,any remaining external blockers for sounder 8?
2004-09-19T16:49:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,there's another amusing initscript bug though
2004-09-19T16:51:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,*groan*
2004-09-19T16:52:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,did you file aa bug and/or tell npmccallum yet?
2004-09-19T16:54:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"just filed, #1088"
2004-09-19T16:55:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"oh, I already fixed that, didn't I?"
2004-09-19T16:58:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"I'm available to give amd64 a whirl before you bless it, if you're ready"
2004-09-19T05:15:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"everything's ready on my end, let me know when you're done"
2004-09-19T05:18:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"CD writer is acting up, working on it"
2004-09-19T05:29:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"yeah, don't wait for me"
2004-09-19T05:53:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,cdrom-detect change?
2004-09-19T07:07:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,what exactly did your question mean? :)
2004-09-19T07:11:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,you said that your cdrom-detect change had a larger effect on performance
2004-09-19T07:11:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,is that where you did the find?
2004-09-19T07:12:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,why is archive-copier a net speed loss?
2004-09-19T07:12:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,in the first stage
2004-09-19T07:12:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"you're doing more work, obviously it's a speed loss :)"
2004-09-19T10:24:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,has anything from restricted been seeded yet?
2004-09-19T10:24:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"no, because there is only one package there, and its name is going to change"
2004-09-19T10:24:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,I'd like that to happen soon if it's going to happen so that I can shake out any bugs in debian-cd it exposes
2004-09-19T10:39:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,they should work fine for http as well
2004-09-19T10:39:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"only if you can contact it, though ..."
2004-09-19T10:39:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,we already agree that we should only uncomment it if it can be contacted
2004-09-19T10:40:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"oh, I see. really?"
2004-09-19T10:40:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"it goes roughly in sources.list order, first-match"
2004-09-19T10:40:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,we could always put http: above cdrom: ...
2004-09-19T10:41:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,then the ship seed is entirely pointless
2004-09-19T10:41:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,my concept of ShipSeed was to have things close by that you might need to get on the network and such
2004-09-19T10:42:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,shipseed has stuff like alternate browsers at the moment
2004-09-19T10:42:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"those are huge; if the user really wants them, they might be grateful to have them on the CD"
2004-09-19T10:42:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,but they won't be able to if the cdrom: URI is zapped
2004-09-19T10:44:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,   * Install S33framebuffer-module-linux-i386 on amd64 too
2004-09-19T10:44:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,is that the only reason the framebuffer didn't work for me on amd64?
2004-09-19T10:45:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"in theory, can't test yet :)"
2004-09-19T10:45:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,agreed
2004-09-19T10:47:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,yes
2004-09-19T10:48:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"if we turned off base-config's cache-cleaning, that would be fine ..."
2004-09-19T10:48:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"oh, I didn't realize we were still cleaning the cahce"
2004-09-19T10:48:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"after aptitude -y install blahrant runs, yes"
2004-09-19T10:50:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,aptitude reimplements significant pieces of apt
2004-09-19T10:51:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,what does apt do if a file: URI disappears? does apt-get update fail?
2004-09-19T10:51:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"yeah, that wouldn't be right. apt gets unhappy if it disappears"
2004-09-19T10:52:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,/var/lib/?
2004-09-19T10:56:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,the second stage already takes a long time; I'm not sure that it's a problem to have 'downloading <foo> from security.no-name-yet.com' show up there
2004-09-19T10:57:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"gives people 'secure by default' warm fuzzies, contrasted with the Windows approach of 'install system then get on the net as fast as you can to download updates before your system is cracked'"
2004-09-19T11:01:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"it takes a long time, but not nearly as long as installing xfree86 over a modem or ISDN"
2004-09-19T11:06:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"ideally, the security updates would be a separate step, which could be run from X while they do other things"
2004-09-19T11:54:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"we should load those on amd64 too, I take it"
2004-09-20T05:59:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,Live (not subset of) Supported is somewhat insanely weird to implement in Germinate
2004-09-20T06:00:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"doable, I guess, but definitely not for 1am contemplation ..."
2004-09-20T06:02:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,I don't mind if Live is required to be a subset of Supported for now
2004-09-20T06:02:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,it's just an idea that might change at some point
2004-09-20T15:07:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,around?
2004-09-22T12:06:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,works for me
2004-09-22T13:54:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,that would explain it
2004-09-23T11:05:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,sounder 8 has it
2004-09-23T11:05:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,thanks
2004-09-23T11:01:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,does sounder 8 have the apt-setup which add the ftp.nny.com sources to sources.list?  or was that added after?
2004-09-23T13:51:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,what do you think is the best way to handle that?
2004-09-23T13:54:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"if you're ok with the changes to base/debootstrap/whatever else, that's probably simplest"
2004-09-23T14:01:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,module-init-tools or similar> agreed I think
2004-09-23T14:02:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"I'm leaning toward the alsa-base postinst solution, myself"
2004-09-23T14:10:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,seem reasonable?
2004-09-23T14:12:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,I'd stick \$ at the end of the grep
2004-09-23T14:21:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"give me a shout if you need debootstrap changes, I'm off to get something to eat now"
2004-09-23T14:22:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"I think I'm leaning in that direction, being unable to easily verify this in the kernel source"
2004-09-23T14:22:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"if you're happy for them to move, I'm happy to consider them appropriate for base as hardware detection stuffs"
2004-09-23T14:40:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,that cinches it; we want alsa-base in Base
2004-09-24T16:00:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,done
2004-09-24T16:46:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,thanks for the new debootstrap
2004-09-25T06:06:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,morning
2004-09-25T06:06:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,wanted to ask you...what's the status of restricted support in germinate/debian-cd/...?
2004-09-25T06:07:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,should all be there
2004-09-25T06:07:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,you'd need to ask elmo whether he runs germinate over main+restricted+universe though
2004-09-25T06:07:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,so I can add linux-restricted-modules-2.6.8.1 to DesktopSeed and it ought to work?
2004-09-25T06:07:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,elmo is hiding
2004-09-25T06:07:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"last I heard, germinate on jackass ran over main+universe, but that was before restricted was implemented"
2004-09-25T06:08:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"yes, it definitely should, I think I've updated everything; if not, give me a shout, it'll be a five-minute job to fix"
2004-09-25T06:08:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"would you be interested in a test build if i do it now, or wait for the next daily?"
2004-09-25T06:08:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,can do
2004-09-25T06:32:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,will you be around for a bit? still on the phone
2004-09-25T06:33:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,I'll be around until c. 2:15/2:30
2004-09-25T06:42:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"hm, in fact I need to make germinate on little run over main+restricted ..."
2004-09-25T06:47:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,do you  know what elmo's caps lock complaint is about?
2004-09-25T06:48:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"afraid not, will test it first thing tomorrow"
2004-09-25T06:51:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,can you point me in the right direction for getting hotplug firmware loading working in d-i?
2004-09-25T06:53:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,put the firmware on a partition you can mount from the installer
2004-09-25T06:53:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"run up to partitioning, ignoring network failures"
2004-09-25T06:53:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"on tty2, mount the partition you put the firmware on, and copy it to /usr/lib/hotplug/firmware/"
2004-09-25T06:53:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,probably copy the relevant kernel modules to the right place as well
2004-09-25T06:54:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"then go back to the d-i main menu and retry the 'detect network hardware' step, and see if it works at all"
2004-09-25T06:55:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,what would be the best way to convince it to let me set a console keymap?
2004-09-25T06:57:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,there is no /sbin/hotplug
2004-09-25T06:57:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"/bin/hotplug-pcmcia, it's set as the hotplug handler for brief periods"
2004-09-25T07:02:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"yeah, so if I tweak all the right knobs, it works"
2004-09-25T07:04:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,starting a new CD build now to see what happens
2004-09-25T07:07:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"uh, how were you planning on getting linux-restricted-modules installed as part of base?"
2004-09-25T07:07:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"debootstrap, presumably?"
2004-09-25T07:07:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,debootstrap can't install it because debootstrap (rightly) doesn't install kernels
2004-09-25T07:12:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,which package provides hotplug-pcmcia?
2004-09-25T07:12:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"something in the ddetect source, hw-detect I think"
2004-09-25T07:15:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,you have new CDs with restricted stuff on them now
2004-09-25T07:18:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"jdub: a friend of mine (also a sounder) wanted to interview me about Ubuntu for a LUG radio thingy, possibly on Wednesday, possibly later"
2004-09-25T07:19:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"jdub: is Wednesday too soon, and if not is there anything in particular you want me to say / not say? :)"
2004-09-25T05:46:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,any particular reason that we don't have *-2.6-* metapackages for linux-restricted-modules? it would help base-installer to behave more sanely
2004-09-25T10:01:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"I was thinking the same thing (metapackages for l-r-m), I think we'll add them"
2004-09-25T11:53:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,did sounder 8 have 2.6.8.1 on i386?
2004-09-25T11:53:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,are you saying that X will already prefer the nvidia binary module if it's present?
2004-09-25T11:53:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,because as of today we install nvidia-kernel-common by default; it's a dependency of linux-restricted-modules
2004-09-25T11:53:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"I am not sure, but it should be quite straightforward to implement, given that nv and nvidia cover the same cards"
2004-09-25T11:54:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,the X driver is in nvidia-glx
2004-09-25T11:55:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,broke netboot insta. Sorry about this. The relevant part of the change was:
2004-09-25T11:55:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,http://archive.ubuntu.com/cdimage/sounder-test/8/warty-i386-1.list says yes
2004-09-25T11:58:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"John was talking about a DVD burner on woody, not warty ... you didn't misread did you?"
2004-09-25T11:58:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"oh, apparently I did"
2004-09-25T12:20:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"regarding the metapackages for linux-restricted-modules, I was going to ask Herbert to do that anyway, but you're OK for preview with it as-is, right?"
2004-09-25T12:21:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,yes; the only glitch is that (as I realized today) we're not actually installing the linux-image metapackages
2004-09-25T12:22:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"when I fix that, the linux-restricted-modules metapackages will need to be there as well otherwise it gets really hairy"
2004-09-25T12:25:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,agreed
2004-09-25T13:19:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,is that base-installer fix-to-the-fix OK with you?
2004-09-25T13:20:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"yes, didn't I OK it in bugzilla alreday?"
2004-09-25T13:22:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,my comment didn't get posted because I got logged out somehow
2004-09-25T13:33:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,there ought to be a new openoffice today
2004-09-25T13:35:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,is anyone other than you currently able to build CD images?
2004-09-25T13:36:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,anyone in the cdimage group on little can log in and type 'DATE_SUFFIX=<whatever> cron.daily'
2004-09-25T13:36:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,so theoretically Alex could do it
2004-09-25T13:36:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"nobody else ever has, though ... I should almost certainly fix that"
2004-09-25T13:36:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"assuming you're planning to sleep tonight, we might want to get someone else (perhaps me) added to that group"
2004-09-25T13:44:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,all the top-level scripts are in /srv/cdimage.no-name-yet.com/bin; I just have that in $PATH
2004-09-25T13:44:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"normally, cron.daily is the only one you need to run (preferably with umask 002)"
2004-09-25T13:44:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"if you're going to do a build anyway, perhaps I should run it as a test"
2004-09-25T13:47:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,so this one should be DATE_SUFFIX=1?
2004-09-25T13:57:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"cron.daily exited, no output"
2004-09-25T14:39:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"I expected cron.daily to create 20040914.1, but it didn't"
2004-09-25T14:40:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"it fell over; I know why, still on phone though"
2004-09-25T14:40:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,ok
2004-09-25T14:57:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,try now
2004-09-25T14:58:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,are you using umask 002?
2004-09-25T14:58:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,022
2004-09-25T14:59:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,I didn't even have a home directory until I logged into that box
2004-09-25T15:01:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,002's be good
2004-09-25T15:01:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,done
2004-09-25T15:32:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"right, sorry about that, old university friend phoned up"
2004-09-25T15:33:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,I have all night :-)
2004-09-25T15:33:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,can you chmod -R g+w everything? there are some directories still owned by you and g-w so I probably won't be able to remove them
2004-09-25T15:33:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,for what value of everything?
2004-09-25T15:34:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,that stuff?
2004-09-25T15:34:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,/srv/cdimage.no-name-yet.com I guess
2004-09-25T15:41:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,see /srv/cdimage.no-name-yet.com/secret/README
2004-09-25T15:42:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,done. shall I try again?
2004-09-25T15:42:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,yep; reusing .1 is fine
2004-09-25T15:46:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,at this rate I'm going to have to add a kludge chmod to the end of cron.daily or something ...
2004-09-25T15:47:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,yes
2004-09-25T15:47:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"if you had a kludge in for that, it can and should be removed"
2004-09-25T15:49:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"kludge gone, not in time for your current build though"
2004-09-25T15:51:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"heh, was ssh waiting for confirmation there?"
2004-09-25T15:52:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"dunno, I had no output"
2004-09-25T15:52:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"if there was any, I assume it was written to the log and not to my tty"
2004-09-25T15:53:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"let's do another one, oo.o on amd64 is worth it"
2004-09-25T15:53:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,would appreciate it if you could do that chmod again
2004-09-25T15:53:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,done
2004-09-25T15:53:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,wait just a sec
2004-09-25T15:53:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"too late, if you meant the chmod"
2004-09-26T16:04:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,another build kicked off
2004-09-26T16:44:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,testing .2/amd64 now
2004-09-26T05:30:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,amd64 install was flawless
2004-09-26T05:31:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,woohoo
2004-09-26T05:57:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"any value in my testing 0914.2 on powerpc, or do you have it covered?"
2004-09-26T05:59:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"I'll be testing it soon, but the more the better"
2004-09-26T06:11:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,would you notice if it were broken?
2004-09-26T06:11:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"apparently it's a hard failure, so should do"
2004-09-26T06:14:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,me too
2004-09-26T06:44:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,yeah
2004-09-26T07:14:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,nautilus seems built now; re-testing powerpc here
2004-09-26T08:16:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,what about openoffice.org-amd64?
2004-09-26T08:17:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,what about it?
2004-09-26T08:24:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,powerpc install was flawless
2004-09-26T08:31:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,bonus
2004-09-26T08:32:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,hooray
2004-09-26T08:38:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"yes, and the dates"
2004-09-26T08:38:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,let's look at rearranging the .torrent files after preview
2004-09-26T08:38:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,rearranging?
2004-09-26T09:22:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"so, we're asking the 'do you want to download updates from the network?' question for both archive.ubuntu.com and security.ubuntu.com in one go, is that right?"
2004-09-26T09:29:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,I don't think we should ask more than one question
2004-09-26T09:31:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,agreed
2004-09-26T09:31:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"the question is whether to ask about archive and default security on, or ask about both"
2004-09-26T09:31:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"one question, 'do you want stuff via the Internet?'"
2004-09-26T11:57:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,still with us?
2004-09-26T11:57:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,yep
2004-09-26T12:43:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"the cdimage crontab will fire too early to catch the base-config I just uploaded (or, rather, I uploaded it too late for the crontab)."
2004-09-26T12:43:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"should I move the crontab, or just build another image when base-config builds?"
2004-09-26T13:26:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,I moved it
2004-09-26T13:26:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,both of them
2004-09-26T13:26:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,where?
2004-09-26T13:35:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,shouldn't we do a set when all oo.o binaries are available?
2004-09-26T13:35:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"probably worth respinning then, yes"
2004-09-26T13:43:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,please don't say that
2004-09-26T13:43:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,please oh please
2004-09-26T13:45:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,it doesn't look like the patch has been applied :-(
2004-09-26T13:45:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,I am starting to get that feeling
2004-09-26T14:57:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,is your mirror out of date?
2004-09-26T14:58:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"I'm encountering that; I don't think it has anything to do with mirror outdatedness, though"
2004-09-26T15:01:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"other than the download weirdness, .1 looks good"
2004-09-26T15:10:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"it's not that tcl8.0, gs, gs-gpl are out of date on little"
2004-09-26T15:10:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"yes, I was just noting that"
2004-09-26T15:10:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"they're not on the CD at all, and shouldn't need to be, but aptitude wants to install them for some reason"
2004-09-26T15:11:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,hmmm
2004-09-26T15:11:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,gs is in universe?!
2004-09-26T15:12:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"oh, we're using gs-esp"
2004-09-26T15:12:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"germinate bug, perhaps?"
2004-09-26T15:13:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"several packages depend on gs, and gs-esp provides gs"
2004-09-26T15:13:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,germinate's fine; looks like aptitude is wanting to install the first package in a |-ed list
2004-09-26T15:16:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,gs in main comes from the gs-gpl source
2004-09-26T15:16:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,you may vomit now
2004-09-26T16:06:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"so, fresh install from CD without taking updates from the network doesn't install tcl8.0,gs,gs-gpl and doesn't object to their absence"
2004-09-26T16:06:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,uncommenting those sources.list entries and doing update/upgrade seems fine too
2004-09-26T16:07:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,I conclude that aptitude is mad and we should not worry about it for preview
2004-09-26T16:08:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,agreed
2004-09-26T16:48:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,fixed gnome-vfs2 is built all around
2004-09-26T16:48:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,shall we roll a new CD?
2004-09-26T16:51:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,coming up
2004-09-26T05:15:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,Computer->Disks->right-click->unmount
2004-09-26T05:16:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,no unmount entry on the right-click menu
2004-09-26T05:16:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,really? works for me
2004-09-26T05:16:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,pumount /dev/foo should work at any rate
2004-09-26T05:16:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"I have 'Eject', not unmount"
2004-09-26T05:40:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,two weird things happened on powerpc just now
2004-09-26T05:40:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"archive-copier's progress bar was confused, and it ejected the CD"
2004-09-26T05:43:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"the progress bar's capped at about 75% at the moment; it's a bug, I know where it is"
2004-09-26T05:43:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,the CD eject is deliberate
2004-09-26T05:46:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,it takes ~1 second to fetch openssh-server from archive.u.c
2004-09-26T05:46:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,compared to 30 seconds or so to get the CD and insert it
2004-09-26T06:06:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,just installing it now
2004-09-26T06:20:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,works for me
2004-09-26T06:34:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"inetd should go away for hoary, likewise for mdadm (where you don't have raid devices)"
2004-09-26T06:36:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,we could just put mdadm in Ship and d-i would sort out installing it at the right times with no effort at all
2004-09-26T06:38:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"it used to, because of the particulars of Linux networking without an IP address"
2004-09-26T06:44:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,encoding/decoding UDP yourself sounds like asking for trouble
2004-09-26T06:44:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,agreed
2004-09-26T07:09:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,feel free ...
2004-09-26T07:09:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"although, yes, a find at the start would help, but there's only so fast it can go"
2004-09-26T07:52:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"I'd be tempted to drop /install/ for the preview, since there isn't a live CD"
2004-09-26T07:52:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,fine by me
2004-09-26T07:53:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,it is increasingly unlikely that we will have anything approaching a live CD corresponding to this release
2004-09-26T07:59:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,all clear to build the next (and hopefully last) CD
2004-09-26T08:14:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"for future optimization, powerpc should build first :-)"
2004-09-26T08:18:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"wouldn't matter anyway, they don't publish to the mirrors until all the architectures have built"
2004-09-26T08:36:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"damnit, you have way more bandwidth than I do"
2004-09-26T08:48:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,just noticed that archive-copier copies all the powerpc subarch kernels
2004-09-26T08:49:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"yes, I mentioned that a few days ago"
2004-09-26T08:49:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"they can't be yet, they rely on the images being in /releases/"
2004-09-26T08:50:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,the torrents have the location in them
2004-09-26T09:01:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,how's powerpc looking?
2004-09-27T12:27:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,have you seen Subject: Re: install instructions on the -users list?
2004-09-27T12:28:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"if you can review the text and make any necessary corrections, lu can integrate it"
2004-09-28T12:38:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,was python-mode one of the things we took out for some reason in that desktop seed blitz? I forget ...
2004-09-28T12:38:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,I don't think so; I didn't even know about it
2004-09-29T16:27:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,here?
2004-09-30T11:52:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,amd64 issues should go to Mithrandir
2004-09-30T11:54:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"heh, pass the buck :-)"
2004-10-01T09:47:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,are you up early or up late?
2004-10-01T09:47:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,late; just off to bed now ...
2004-10-01T09:47:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,you should know by now that I'm not one of these early-to-rise freaks ;)
2004-10-01T09:48:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,true
2004-10-02T05:51:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,I take it you don't feel like adding 64MB to the CD for the other kernels
2004-10-02T05:52:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"we have about 100M left, right?"
2004-10-02T05:52:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,there is a linux-source-*.deb though
2004-10-02T06:41:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,looks good to me
2004-10-02T05:55:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"rough back-of-an-envelope calculations say 125MB on amd64, 140MB on i386, 72MB on powerpc"
2004-10-02T05:55:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,remaining?
2004-10-02T05:55:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,yep
2004-10-02T05:55:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,eek
2004-10-02T05:57:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,it's held very steady for the last week; about 40MB lost since Sounder 8
2004-10-02T05:57:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"shame about not defaulting to NPTL if possible, mind"
2004-10-02T05:58:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"for Hoary we should have my new base-installer, which may let us be a little more flexible (e.g. include just the -686 kernel and have higher CPUs fall back down to it)"
2004-10-02T05:59:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,would you be willing to make a quick test CD if we move pcmcia-cs out to ShipSeed?
2004-10-02T05:59:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,sure
2004-10-02T05:59:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,I'd like to give it a run through
2004-10-02T05:59:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,would it be possible to it without tweaking the seeds as a trial? I seem to recall you had overrides of some sort
2004-10-02T06:00:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"not really as sophisticated as overrides, but I have a script ... :)"
2004-10-02T06:00:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"(hey, I could use germinate hints, couldn't I? that would be CLEVER.)"
2004-10-02T06:01:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,at some point we'll need to add documentation and suchlike
2004-10-02T06:01:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"speaking of, please beat me up until I do an installation manual branding job"
2004-10-02T06:05:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"hm, it's not a CD matter, I need a different debootstrap script to change Base"
2004-10-02T06:05:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,how about you install from an existing CD but edit pcmcia-cs out of /usr/lib/debootstrap/scripts/warty before debootstrap starts?
2004-10-02T06:05:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,I'll go and try that on my desktop amd64 now
2004-10-02T06:40:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,latest patch to #1337 includes bootloader configuration changes
2004-10-02T06:20:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,seems to correctly not install pcmcia-cs on a desktop
2004-10-02T06:42:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"if uploaded now, we could roll a test CD tomorrow with this and the pcmcia-cs changes, right?"
2004-10-02T06:44:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,can I also add acpi-modules to amd64 while I'm at it?
2004-10-02T06:45:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,certainly
2004-10-02T06:46:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"OK, starting uploads now"
2004-10-02T06:47:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,so does the daily CD build use the d-i build done earlier that day?  or one that you've blessed?
2004-10-02T06:48:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,it uses the daily build at the moment
2004-10-02T06:48:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"but it relies on elmo being awake to byhand it, so it's usually the previous day's build"
2004-10-08T15:58:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,back?
2004-10-11T05:32:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,also an ntfsresize hack was added to partman very recently
2004-10-11T06:10:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,good call
2004-10-13T07:09:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,that's American English
2004-10-24T10:59:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"no, we don't do that either"
2004-10-24T11:00:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"don't we use -Wl,-O1? Jeff said we were using that everywhere"
2004-10-24T11:00:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,some of the GNOME packages use it
2004-09-04T08:40:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"setuid /bin/mount is going to be disabled in favour of pmount, which doesn't require entries in fstab"
2004-09-04T08:42:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,done
2004-09-04T14:21:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"speaking of hate mail, we need to re-enable the hostname question in d-i"
2004-09-04T14:25:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"under all circumstances, I take it?"
2004-09-04T14:26:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,I would say so
2004-09-04T14:27:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,done
2004-09-04T14:27:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,I will accept responsibility for the additional question :-)
2004-09-05T16:39:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,what time were you planning to roll Sounder 7?
2004-09-05T16:59:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,you're free to statoverride /bin/mount and edit fstab
2004-09-05T05:01:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"if you need to start now, then do it.  it's more important to get sounder 7 out than to have usplash"
2004-09-05T05:18:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,that's a known bug in thom's acpid upload
2004-09-05T05:18:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,please do file a bug to remind him
2004-09-05T05:21:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"if you have time to do it, reverting ubuntu4 is fine with me"
2004-09-05T11:53:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,I believe the final scheme for the version number was with a dash (4-10)
2004-09-05T12:58:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"indeed. it's a Recommends: thing, fixed"
2004-09-05T13:07:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"actually, if we're going the archive-copier route we absolutely want this approach"
2004-09-05T13:08:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,archive-copier would handle base as well?
2004-09-05T13:10:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,does this include all of the shipseed additions we made in Oxford?
2004-09-05T13:10:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"that's all entirely automatic now, so yes"
2004-09-05T13:58:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,barking?
2004-09-05T14:15:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"archive-copier seems to do the right thing for me, as far as copying"
2004-09-05T14:23:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"apt-cdrom add, too"
2004-09-05T14:24:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"by the time I logged in on vt2 to look, /var/cache/apt/archives was empty"
2004-09-05T14:29:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"oh, damn, I forgot to mention that; you also need to boot with KEEP_DEBS=yes"
2004-09-05T14:34:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,apparently this happens when xresprobe can't
2004-09-05T14:34:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"yeah, I'm prodding it now.  but it was detecting my LCD OK in Oxford"
2004-09-05T14:42:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,this is the d-i-with-no-network case
2004-09-06T05:16:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,Applications->System Tools->Terminal?
2004-09-06T05:41:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,is more awake than I am
2004-09-06T07:44:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"working on upgrading our netcfg to be based on Debian 1.01, which has several fixes we want; hope that's ok"
2004-09-06T07:46:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"if you're ok, I'm ok"
2004-09-06T08:16:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"oh, forgot to mention...I did another round of sounder 7 testing using archive-copier and KEEP_DEBS=yes; seemed to work perfectly"
2004-09-06T08:20:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,kewl
2004-09-06T08:25:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"that iftab thing in netcfg could go upstream, couldn't it?"
2004-09-06T08:26:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,I assume so
2004-09-06T11:54:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,yes
2004-09-06T11:56:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,why is it named 'fortune-mod' anyway?
2004-09-06T11:56:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,I've often wondered that
2004-09-06T11:57:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"come to look, fortunes-min is actually pretty reasonable"
2004-09-06T12:03:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,quite likely
2004-09-06T12:04:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,s'what I thought
2004-09-07T09:06:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"ooh, we have a sorted daily now?"
2004-09-07T09:09:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,for a while ...
2004-09-07T09:09:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,I was wondering if sorting the directory inodes with the files they contain would help too - they're all at the start at the moment
2004-09-07T09:50:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,what would be a safe time of day to automatically rsync the current daily iso?
2004-09-07T10:07:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"the dailies are always finished by 8:45 UTC, and almost always finished by 7:30 UTC; I don't know what the two freak late ones were about"
2004-09-07T10:22:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,thanks
2004-09-07T10:38:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"with the sorted CD, it seems to do quite well on source packages with multiple binaries, but it still seems to seek every time it has to read a new directory"
2004-09-07T10:40:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"ok, sounds like I'll have to twiddle that a bit; I can probably sort directories with the .debs they contain relatively easily"
2004-09-07T09:27:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,fascinating...in #268421 the submitter pasted the entire status file entry as the debbugs pseudo-header
2004-09-07T09:28:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,cool
2004-09-07T10:37:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,console-data asked me a question on upgrade for some reason
2004-09-07T10:40:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,no idea; what does echo GET debconf/priority | debconf-communicate say?
2004-09-07T10:40:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"wasn't anything I changed anyway, I don't think"
2004-09-07T10:41:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,0 high
2004-09-11T10:11:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,did that make it onto your todo list?
2004-09-11T10:12:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,what do you think?
2004-09-11T10:12:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"yeah, I was thinking it was, but then, the last message is worded such that people don't generally read it"
2004-09-11T10:13:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"true, but that applies to most of the installer"
2004-09-11T10:14:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,easy to put a comment in /etc/sudoers about it ... power users can remove it
2004-09-11T12:13:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"so, am I doing the timestamp_timeout=0 thing or not? I'm about to upload base-config for another reason ..."
2004-09-11T12:13:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,it's OK with me if you and pitti agree
2004-09-11T12:14:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,it sounded like there was a consensus on #warthogs
2004-09-11T12:55:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,does Keybuk's laptop overheat itself during the install if we don't?
2004-09-11T13:10:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,can you send him an email and ask him about the ACPI stuff?
2004-09-12T06:04:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,absolutely not; I'd prefer it
2004-09-12T10:48:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,removing eth1394 from hw-detect now
2004-09-12T10:48:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"ok, I'll upload hotplug"
2004-09-13T06:11:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,why doesn't evolution1.5 install on its own?  was it missing when the CD was built or something?
2004-09-13T06:13:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,works for me; do you just mean the way aptitude won't install anything if one piece of the task is uninstallable?
2004-09-13T06:14:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"oh, so it's just fallout from the evolution-* uninstallability then?"
2004-09-13T06:14:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"well, when I do it using aptitude by hand then I get evolution1.5 installed, so I guess so"
2004-09-13T06:21:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"we can, but it makes the output awfully unreadable"
2004-09-13T06:23:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"they use the same method, which is the root of the issue I suppose"
2004-09-13T06:24:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"pkgSourceList::Describe, I believe"
2004-09-13T06:26:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"hmm, it actually does that explicitly"
2004-09-13T15:52:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"stopping adding /cdrom to fstab is non-trivially fiddly, because integration between d-i and base-config is involved there"
2004-09-13T13:12:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,?
2004-09-13T13:36:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"npmccallum: when I looked at the eject upload, it did not look like it depended on pmount. did I miss something?"
2004-09-13T13:39:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"yes, it is actually a bit higher level than mount"
2004-09-13T13:40:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,which version of eject is that from?
2004-09-13T13:40:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,2.0.13deb-6ubuntu1
2004-09-13T13:41:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,quite :-)
2004-09-13T13:44:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,no
2004-09-13T13:44:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"by 'fixing' do you mean moving the dependency to eject, or removing it altogether?"
2004-09-13T13:45:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,removing the dependency and having it fall back to standard umount
2004-09-13T13:45:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"ah, good"
2004-09-13T13:57:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,pitti: is the initial user added to plugdev?
2004-09-13T14:00:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"yes, it just occurred to me earlier today (after joeyh asked about it) that that might be why our /etc/default/gdm was ending up mode 0600"
2004-09-13T14:00:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,that was only filed as important(!)
2004-09-14T08:47:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,ip has had a man page for _ages_
2004-09-14T08:49:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,what's your opinion on the sbin question?
2004-09-14T08:54:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,mousedev is totally generic input layer goodness
2004-09-14T08:55:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,:-(
2004-09-14T08:56:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,there really should be a sane kernel-level way to handle this
2004-09-14T08:58:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"we could just compile in mousedev everywhere, too"
2004-09-14T08:58:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"why is it done that way on powerpc, anyway?"
2004-09-14T08:58:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,because you always want it? who knows
2004-09-14T09:00:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,thanks
2004-09-14T11:25:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,you're still awake?? or up early?
2004-09-14T06:00:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"don't think I was still awake by 6:25, but I was up depressingly late for no very good reason"
2004-09-14T11:05:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"today's daily worked, anyway"
2004-09-14T11:05:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"oh, good"
2004-09-14T15:21:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"custom-expert (name sucks, I know) is base-only and low priority, in case you ever need that"
2004-09-14T15:34:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,just trying an install with the current daily
2004-09-14T15:50:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,I think you're right that it's the directory ordering on the CD that's slowing things down
2004-09-14T15:54:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,what should we do about archive-copier vs. apt-cdrom?
2004-09-15T16:06:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,let me know when there's a CD up and I'll give it a try; I'm quite interested to see the difference
2004-09-15T16:11:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"Scots prefer the spelling whisky; Americans follow instead the Irish spelling, so Kentucky bourbon is whiskey."
2004-09-15T16:46:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"I know which is which, certainly :-)"
2004-09-15T16:46:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,I had been wondering whether to have Scotch or Irish
2004-09-15T16:46:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,ah :-)
2004-09-15T05:00:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,maybe
2004-09-15T05:03:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"yeah, that's what I meant"
2004-09-15T05:05:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,grub-installer is missing from the amd64 CD; is that intentional?
2004-09-15T05:07:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"that is, it's not on the CD at all"
2004-09-15T05:12:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,not in the archive
2004-09-15T05:18:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,bug filed
2004-09-16T10:39:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"that alone should not cause the script to fail, should it?  if it were set -e, then whichever command actually produced the nonzero $? would have terminated the script, no?"
2004-09-16T10:39:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,look more closely at bug #1019; the && means set -e doesn't trigger
2004-09-16T11:01:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,can we have a debian-installer component in bugzilla so that people stop assigning bugs to libdebian-installer?
2004-09-16T11:01:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,yes
2004-09-16T11:02:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,done
2004-09-17T15:12:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"so, what does the latest build failure look like?"
2004-09-17T11:39:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"file a bug about that 2>/dev/null, please"
2004-09-17T11:40:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,i386 kernel built fine; powerpc and amd64 weren't implemented until this morning
2004-09-17T11:57:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,so the current amd64 daily should be a good one?
2004-09-17T12:23:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,thanks for the d-i changes for the kernel
2004-09-17T13:12:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"yes, current amd64 daily should be ok ..."
2004-09-17T13:13:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"if you're uploading linux-source-2.6.8.1 again, I can hold the sounder release until we've got all the d-i ducks in a row for all architectures; shouldn't take too long to do the remaining two"
2004-09-17T13:30:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,I've uploaded it again
2004-09-17T13:30:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"it should build all of i386, amd64 and powerpc now"
2004-09-17T13:30:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"will wait for builds, then do l-k-di-*, then build other stuff, then ..."
2004-09-17T13:33:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,any clue?
2004-09-17T13:48:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"would be better now to wait for a new kernel-package to build and just rebuild with that, I think"
2004-09-17T14:45:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,what sort of base-installer support for amd64?
2004-09-17T14:48:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"should I test the current amd64 daily, or wait for the next one?"
2004-09-17T14:51:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,was that an explicit change from boot-floppies?
2004-09-17T14:51:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,pcmcia-cs isn't particularly related to boot-floppies?
2004-09-17T14:51:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"base-config maybe?  anyway, in woody, pcmcia-cs was removed on systems without pcmcia"
2004-09-17T14:52:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"oh, gotcha"
2004-09-17T14:57:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"great, so the next daily should be 2.6.8.1 across the board?"
2004-09-17T15:10:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"thom: regarding bugzilla, either of you want to file a wishlist bug to ask justdave about it?"
2004-09-17T15:18:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,do you have a new linux-kernel-di for powerpc ready for when the kernel itself is built?
2004-09-17T15:42:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"hmm, I didn't think udebs had init scripts"
2004-09-17T15:43:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,pcmcia is a special case
2004-09-17T15:43:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,is it the only such?
2004-09-17T15:43:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,the only one I know of
2004-09-18T07:09:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,he's gone :-/
2004-09-18T07:12:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,is it OK to update the seeds for 2.6.8.1?
2004-09-18T07:13:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"crap, forgot about that for amd64 :)"
2004-09-18T07:13:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"you do base, I'll do installer"
2004-09-18T07:14:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,amd64?  base doesnt' seem to have been updated for any arches
2004-09-18T07:14:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,base should only need doing for powerpc in fact ...
2004-09-18T07:14:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,base still says kernel-image-2.6-386
2004-09-18T07:14:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"base doesn't need it for i386/amd64, it uses the metapackages"
2004-09-18T07:14:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,... oh
2004-09-18T07:14:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"wrong metapackages, right"
2004-09-18T07:19:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,updated base and supported
2004-09-18T07:23:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,looked through all and extra; seems to be in order
2004-09-18T07:27:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,what's the location of your new germinate archive?
2004-09-18T07:34:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,does b-i have the smarts to select the tasty optimized kernel for all warty architectures?
2004-09-18T07:39:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,I talked to mark about it on the phone today
2004-09-18T07:41:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"BTW, I guessed that misdn wasn't needed in d-i, but might've been wrong"
2004-09-18T07:41:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"dunno, probably a question for doko"
2004-09-18T07:49:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,ipw2200
2004-09-18T08:06:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,going to make archive-copier the default for Sounder 8; it isn't going to get enough feedback otherwise
2004-09-18T09:20:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,sounds good
2004-09-18T09:26:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,why is bicyclerepair under 'Germinate workarounds' in DesktopSeed?
2004-09-18T09:27:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"misplaced, I suppose"
2004-09-18T09:38:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,I probably just wasn't paying attention to the different types of headings in the file when I added them
2004-09-18T09:41:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"if that applies to the version we ship, then yes, certainly"
2004-09-18T09:45:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,the changelog is convincing
2004-09-18T09:50:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"speaking of getting up, don't you need to sleep eventually so that you can do that too? :-)"
2004-09-18T09:20:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"if you wanted to remove pppoe, then pppoeconf will need to go too"
2004-09-18T09:21:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,it shouldn't
2004-09-18T09:28:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,is this a problem for the CD build?
2004-09-18T09:30:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,not too bothered
2004-09-18T10:03:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"let's see if we can put our heads together and come up with a strategy for it, and then it can go offline"
2004-09-18T10:03:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,ok
2004-09-18T10:15:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,I agree
2004-09-18T10:21:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,right
2004-09-18T10:25:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"well, I made an attempt to get firmware loading support going, but I doubt that it works"
2004-09-18T10:25:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"apart from the firmware issues, is there a wlanctl-ng udeb?"
2004-09-18T10:25:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,I can look at firmware support with you; I have hardware I can test with
2004-09-18T10:42:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"we may not even have anything outstanding from his list, but we'll see"
2004-09-18T10:49:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,I don't think that's a big deal myself
2004-09-18T10:54:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,ok
2004-09-18T10:56:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,what shall we do about a udeb for l-r-m?
2004-09-18T10:57:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,pick it apart in linux-kernel-di?
2004-09-18T10:58:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"that would produce essentially restricted udebs, but in main"
2004-09-18T10:58:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,I was thinking a separate kernel-wedge-using thing
2004-09-18T10:58:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"hmm, yes, that would mean linux-kernel-di would build-dep on the restricted modules, yuck"
2004-09-18T10:58:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"BTW, I do have another idea for cutting down the udeb problem; we can reunify linux-kernel-di-*"
2004-09-18T10:59:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"ooh, that sounds nice"
2004-09-18T10:59:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"it might run into apt limits though, I'm sure you're familiar with that problem ..."
2004-09-18T10:59:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"I think I bumped those limits high enough in current apt, but it's easy enough to bump them again if necessary"
2004-09-18T11:00:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"that's not the issue, think woody->warty upgrades ..."
2004-09-18T11:00:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,woody->warty upgrades require an apt pre-upgrade to work well anyway
2004-09-18T11:00:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,the point is it can get hard to even apt-get update
2004-09-18T11:01:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"we'll drown under that bridge when we come to it, I guess :-)"
2004-09-18T11:13:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,sure
2004-09-18T11:15:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,let's hold off until we've decided on the final list
2004-09-18T11:15:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,I'll just remove pppoe for this release then
2004-09-18T11:15:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,ok
2004-09-18T11:20:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,a quick update on the installer is the last item on my agenda
2004-09-18T11:23:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"in fact, if it's ok with you, I'd like to test a sounder 8 candidate before you bless it"
2004-09-18T11:23:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,sure
2004-09-18T11:25:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"is it just a matter of increasing the priority, or is it trickier than that?"
2004-09-18T11:25:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"resizing ext3 not working; may be a parted issue, haven't diagnosed it yet"
2004-09-18T11:25:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"increasing the priority would fix it, but may incur Mark's wrath at an additional question :-)"
2004-09-18T11:25:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"it would only be asked if it couldn't associate without one, no?"
2004-09-18T11:26:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"I think it's asked regardless, but wouldn't swear to it"
2004-09-18T11:28:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,is the question which devices should be added to fstab?
2004-09-18T11:29:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,yes
2004-09-18T12:14:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,ready to test when you are
2004-09-18T13:53:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,I was just thinking
2004-09-18T13:53:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,apt-cdrom essentially does 'find /cdrom/'
2004-09-18T13:53:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,maybe that could substitute for your explicit find
2004-09-18T14:01:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"probably not in cdrom-detect, since apt-cdrom isn't even close to installed yet ..."
2004-09-18T14:17:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"but yes, apt-cdrom would substitute for it in the case where you aren't using archive-copier; I didn't make any post-reboot changes along those lines"
2004-09-18T15:17:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,new daily is up
2004-09-19T16:36:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,eh?  it seems to do utf-8 by default
2004-09-19T16:42:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"I tried changing the locale in a new tab, but it doesn't seem to display Unicode characters correctly when I do that"
2004-09-19T16:43:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"hmm, I thought there was a profile setting for that, but I guess it sets it based on your locale when you start it"
2004-09-19T16:45:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,any remaining external blockers for sounder 8?
2004-09-19T16:49:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,there's another amusing initscript bug though
2004-09-19T16:51:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,*groan*
2004-09-19T16:52:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,did you file aa bug and/or tell npmccallum yet?
2004-09-19T16:54:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"just filed, #1088"
2004-09-19T16:55:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"oh, I already fixed that, didn't I?"
2004-09-19T16:58:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"I'm available to give amd64 a whirl before you bless it, if you're ready"
2004-09-19T05:15:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"everything's ready on my end, let me know when you're done"
2004-09-19T05:18:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"CD writer is acting up, working on it"
2004-09-19T05:29:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"yeah, don't wait for me"
2004-09-19T05:53:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,cdrom-detect change?
2004-09-19T07:07:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,what exactly did your question mean? :)
2004-09-19T07:11:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,you said that your cdrom-detect change had a larger effect on performance
2004-09-19T07:11:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,is that where you did the find?
2004-09-19T07:12:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,why is archive-copier a net speed loss?
2004-09-19T07:12:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,in the first stage
2004-09-19T07:12:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"you're doing more work, obviously it's a speed loss :)"
2004-09-19T10:24:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,has anything from restricted been seeded yet?
2004-09-19T10:24:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"no, because there is only one package there, and its name is going to change"
2004-09-19T10:24:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,I'd like that to happen soon if it's going to happen so that I can shake out any bugs in debian-cd it exposes
2004-09-19T10:39:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,they should work fine for http as well
2004-09-19T10:39:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"only if you can contact it, though ..."
2004-09-19T10:39:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,we already agree that we should only uncomment it if it can be contacted
2004-09-19T10:40:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"oh, I see. really?"
2004-09-19T10:40:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"it goes roughly in sources.list order, first-match"
2004-09-19T10:40:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,we could always put http: above cdrom: ...
2004-09-19T10:41:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,then the ship seed is entirely pointless
2004-09-19T10:41:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,my concept of ShipSeed was to have things close by that you might need to get on the network and such
2004-09-19T10:42:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,shipseed has stuff like alternate browsers at the moment
2004-09-19T10:42:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"those are huge; if the user really wants them, they might be grateful to have them on the CD"
2004-09-19T10:42:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,but they won't be able to if the cdrom: URI is zapped
2004-09-19T10:44:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,   * Install S33framebuffer-module-linux-i386 on amd64 too
2004-09-19T10:44:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,is that the only reason the framebuffer didn't work for me on amd64?
2004-09-19T10:45:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"in theory, can't test yet :)"
2004-09-19T10:45:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,agreed
2004-09-19T10:47:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,yes
2004-09-19T10:48:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"if we turned off base-config's cache-cleaning, that would be fine ..."
2004-09-19T10:48:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"oh, I didn't realize we were still cleaning the cahce"
2004-09-19T10:48:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"after aptitude -y install blahrant runs, yes"
2004-09-19T10:50:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,aptitude reimplements significant pieces of apt
2004-09-19T10:51:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,what does apt do if a file: URI disappears? does apt-get update fail?
2004-09-19T10:51:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"yeah, that wouldn't be right. apt gets unhappy if it disappears"
2004-09-19T10:52:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,/var/lib/?
2004-09-19T10:56:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,the second stage already takes a long time; I'm not sure that it's a problem to have 'downloading <foo> from security.no-name-yet.com' show up there
2004-09-19T10:57:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"gives people 'secure by default' warm fuzzies, contrasted with the Windows approach of 'install system then get on the net as fast as you can to download updates before your system is cracked'"
2004-09-19T11:01:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"it takes a long time, but not nearly as long as installing xfree86 over a modem or ISDN"
2004-09-19T11:06:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"ideally, the security updates would be a separate step, which could be run from X while they do other things"
2004-09-19T11:54:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"we should load those on amd64 too, I take it"
2004-09-20T05:59:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,Live (not subset of) Supported is somewhat insanely weird to implement in Germinate
2004-09-20T06:00:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"doable, I guess, but definitely not for 1am contemplation ..."
2004-09-20T06:02:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,I don't mind if Live is required to be a subset of Supported for now
2004-09-20T06:02:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,it's just an idea that might change at some point
2004-09-20T15:07:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,around?
2004-09-22T12:06:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,works for me
2004-09-22T13:54:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,that would explain it
2004-09-23T11:05:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,sounder 8 has it
2004-09-23T11:05:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,thanks
2004-09-23T11:01:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,does sounder 8 have the apt-setup which add the ftp.nny.com sources to sources.list?  or was that added after?
2004-09-23T13:51:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,what do you think is the best way to handle that?
2004-09-23T13:54:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"if you're ok with the changes to base/debootstrap/whatever else, that's probably simplest"
2004-09-23T14:01:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,module-init-tools or similar> agreed I think
2004-09-23T14:02:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"I'm leaning toward the alsa-base postinst solution, myself"
2004-09-23T14:10:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,seem reasonable?
2004-09-23T14:12:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,I'd stick \$ at the end of the grep
2004-09-23T14:21:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"give me a shout if you need debootstrap changes, I'm off to get something to eat now"
2004-09-23T14:22:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"I think I'm leaning in that direction, being unable to easily verify this in the kernel source"
2004-09-23T14:22:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"if you're happy for them to move, I'm happy to consider them appropriate for base as hardware detection stuffs"
2004-09-23T14:40:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,that cinches it; we want alsa-base in Base
2004-09-24T16:00:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,done
2004-09-24T16:46:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,thanks for the new debootstrap
2004-09-25T06:06:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,morning
2004-09-25T06:06:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,wanted to ask you...what's the status of restricted support in germinate/debian-cd/...?
2004-09-25T06:07:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,should all be there
2004-09-25T06:07:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,you'd need to ask elmo whether he runs germinate over main+restricted+universe though
2004-09-25T06:07:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,so I can add linux-restricted-modules-2.6.8.1 to DesktopSeed and it ought to work?
2004-09-25T06:07:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,elmo is hiding
2004-09-25T06:07:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"last I heard, germinate on jackass ran over main+universe, but that was before restricted was implemented"
2004-09-25T06:08:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"yes, it definitely should, I think I've updated everything; if not, give me a shout, it'll be a five-minute job to fix"
2004-09-25T06:08:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"would you be interested in a test build if i do it now, or wait for the next daily?"
2004-09-25T06:08:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,can do
2004-09-25T06:32:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,will you be around for a bit? still on the phone
2004-09-25T06:33:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,I'll be around until c. 2:15/2:30
2004-09-25T06:42:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"hm, in fact I need to make germinate on little run over main+restricted ..."
2004-09-25T06:47:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,do you  know what elmo's caps lock complaint is about?
2004-09-25T06:48:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"afraid not, will test it first thing tomorrow"
2004-09-25T06:51:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,can you point me in the right direction for getting hotplug firmware loading working in d-i?
2004-09-25T06:53:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,put the firmware on a partition you can mount from the installer
2004-09-25T06:53:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"run up to partitioning, ignoring network failures"
2004-09-25T06:53:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"on tty2, mount the partition you put the firmware on, and copy it to /usr/lib/hotplug/firmware/"
2004-09-25T06:53:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,probably copy the relevant kernel modules to the right place as well
2004-09-25T06:54:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"then go back to the d-i main menu and retry the 'detect network hardware' step, and see if it works at all"
2004-09-25T06:55:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,what would be the best way to convince it to let me set a console keymap?
2004-09-25T06:57:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,there is no /sbin/hotplug
2004-09-25T06:57:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"/bin/hotplug-pcmcia, it's set as the hotplug handler for brief periods"
2004-09-25T07:02:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"yeah, so if I tweak all the right knobs, it works"
2004-09-25T07:04:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,starting a new CD build now to see what happens
2004-09-25T07:07:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"uh, how were you planning on getting linux-restricted-modules installed as part of base?"
2004-09-25T07:07:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"debootstrap, presumably?"
2004-09-25T07:07:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,debootstrap can't install it because debootstrap (rightly) doesn't install kernels
2004-09-25T07:12:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,which package provides hotplug-pcmcia?
2004-09-25T07:12:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"something in the ddetect source, hw-detect I think"
2004-09-25T07:15:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,you have new CDs with restricted stuff on them now
2004-09-25T07:18:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"jdub: a friend of mine (also a sounder) wanted to interview me about Ubuntu for a LUG radio thingy, possibly on Wednesday, possibly later"
2004-09-25T07:19:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"jdub: is Wednesday too soon, and if not is there anything in particular you want me to say / not say? :)"
2004-09-25T05:46:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,any particular reason that we don't have *-2.6-* metapackages for linux-restricted-modules? it would help base-installer to behave more sanely
2004-09-25T10:01:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"I was thinking the same thing (metapackages for l-r-m), I think we'll add them"
2004-09-25T11:53:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,did sounder 8 have 2.6.8.1 on i386?
2004-09-25T11:53:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,are you saying that X will already prefer the nvidia binary module if it's present?
2004-09-25T11:53:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,because as of today we install nvidia-kernel-common by default; it's a dependency of linux-restricted-modules
2004-09-25T11:53:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"I am not sure, but it should be quite straightforward to implement, given that nv and nvidia cover the same cards"
2004-09-25T11:54:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,the X driver is in nvidia-glx
2004-09-25T11:55:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,broke netboot insta. Sorry about this. The relevant part of the change was:
2004-09-25T11:55:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,http://archive.ubuntu.com/cdimage/sounder-test/8/warty-i386-1.list says yes
2004-09-25T11:58:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"John was talking about a DVD burner on woody, not warty ... you didn't misread did you?"
2004-09-25T11:58:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"oh, apparently I did"
2004-09-25T12:20:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"regarding the metapackages for linux-restricted-modules, I was going to ask Herbert to do that anyway, but you're OK for preview with it as-is, right?"
2004-09-25T12:21:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,yes; the only glitch is that (as I realized today) we're not actually installing the linux-image metapackages
2004-09-25T12:22:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"when I fix that, the linux-restricted-modules metapackages will need to be there as well otherwise it gets really hairy"
2004-09-25T12:25:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,agreed
2004-09-25T13:19:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,is that base-installer fix-to-the-fix OK with you?
2004-09-25T13:20:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"yes, didn't I OK it in bugzilla alreday?"
2004-09-25T13:22:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,my comment didn't get posted because I got logged out somehow
2004-09-25T13:33:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,there ought to be a new openoffice today
2004-09-25T13:35:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,is anyone other than you currently able to build CD images?
2004-09-25T13:36:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,anyone in the cdimage group on little can log in and type 'DATE_SUFFIX=<whatever> cron.daily'
2004-09-25T13:36:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,so theoretically Alex could do it
2004-09-25T13:36:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"nobody else ever has, though ... I should almost certainly fix that"
2004-09-25T13:36:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"assuming you're planning to sleep tonight, we might want to get someone else (perhaps me) added to that group"
2004-09-25T13:44:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,all the top-level scripts are in /srv/cdimage.no-name-yet.com/bin; I just have that in $PATH
2004-09-25T13:44:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"normally, cron.daily is the only one you need to run (preferably with umask 002)"
2004-09-25T13:44:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"if you're going to do a build anyway, perhaps I should run it as a test"
2004-09-25T13:47:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,so this one should be DATE_SUFFIX=1?
2004-09-25T13:57:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"cron.daily exited, no output"
2004-09-25T14:39:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"I expected cron.daily to create 20040914.1, but it didn't"
2004-09-25T14:40:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"it fell over; I know why, still on phone though"
2004-09-25T14:40:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,ok
2004-09-25T14:57:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,try now
2004-09-25T14:58:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,are you using umask 002?
2004-09-25T14:58:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,022
2004-09-25T14:59:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,I didn't even have a home directory until I logged into that box
2004-09-25T15:01:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,002's be good
2004-09-25T15:01:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,done
2004-09-25T15:32:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"right, sorry about that, old university friend phoned up"
2004-09-25T15:33:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,I have all night :-)
2004-09-25T15:33:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,can you chmod -R g+w everything? there are some directories still owned by you and g-w so I probably won't be able to remove them
2004-09-25T15:33:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,for what value of everything?
2004-09-25T15:34:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,that stuff?
2004-09-25T15:34:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,/srv/cdimage.no-name-yet.com I guess
2004-09-25T15:41:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,see /srv/cdimage.no-name-yet.com/secret/README
2004-09-25T15:42:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,done. shall I try again?
2004-09-25T15:42:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,yep; reusing .1 is fine
2004-09-25T15:46:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,at this rate I'm going to have to add a kludge chmod to the end of cron.daily or something ...
2004-09-25T15:47:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,yes
2004-09-25T15:47:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"if you had a kludge in for that, it can and should be removed"
2004-09-25T15:49:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"kludge gone, not in time for your current build though"
2004-09-25T15:51:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"heh, was ssh waiting for confirmation there?"
2004-09-25T15:52:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"dunno, I had no output"
2004-09-25T15:52:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"if there was any, I assume it was written to the log and not to my tty"
2004-09-25T15:53:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"let's do another one, oo.o on amd64 is worth it"
2004-09-25T15:53:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,would appreciate it if you could do that chmod again
2004-09-25T15:53:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,done
2004-09-25T15:53:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,wait just a sec
2004-09-25T15:53:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"too late, if you meant the chmod"
2004-09-26T16:04:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,another build kicked off
2004-09-26T16:44:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,testing .2/amd64 now
2004-09-26T05:30:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,amd64 install was flawless
2004-09-26T05:31:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,woohoo
2004-09-26T05:57:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"any value in my testing 0914.2 on powerpc, or do you have it covered?"
2004-09-26T05:59:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"I'll be testing it soon, but the more the better"
2004-09-26T06:11:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,would you notice if it were broken?
2004-09-26T06:11:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"apparently it's a hard failure, so should do"
2004-09-26T06:14:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,me too
2004-09-26T06:44:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,yeah
2004-09-26T07:14:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,nautilus seems built now; re-testing powerpc here
2004-09-26T08:16:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,what about openoffice.org-amd64?
2004-09-26T08:17:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,what about it?
2004-09-26T08:24:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,powerpc install was flawless
2004-09-26T08:31:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,bonus
2004-09-26T08:32:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,hooray
2004-09-26T08:38:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"yes, and the dates"
2004-09-26T08:38:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,let's look at rearranging the .torrent files after preview
2004-09-26T08:38:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,rearranging?
2004-09-26T09:22:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"so, we're asking the 'do you want to download updates from the network?' question for both archive.ubuntu.com and security.ubuntu.com in one go, is that right?"
2004-09-26T09:29:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,I don't think we should ask more than one question
2004-09-26T09:31:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,agreed
2004-09-26T09:31:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"the question is whether to ask about archive and default security on, or ask about both"
2004-09-26T09:31:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"one question, 'do you want stuff via the Internet?'"
2004-09-26T11:57:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,still with us?
2004-09-26T11:57:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,yep
2004-09-26T12:43:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"the cdimage crontab will fire too early to catch the base-config I just uploaded (or, rather, I uploaded it too late for the crontab)."
2004-09-26T12:43:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"should I move the crontab, or just build another image when base-config builds?"
2004-09-26T13:26:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,I moved it
2004-09-26T13:26:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,both of them
2004-09-26T13:26:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,where?
2004-09-26T13:35:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,shouldn't we do a set when all oo.o binaries are available?
2004-09-26T13:35:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"probably worth respinning then, yes"
2004-09-26T13:43:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,please don't say that
2004-09-26T13:43:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,please oh please
2004-09-26T13:45:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,it doesn't look like the patch has been applied :-(
2004-09-26T13:45:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,I am starting to get that feeling
2004-09-26T14:57:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,is your mirror out of date?
2004-09-26T14:58:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"I'm encountering that; I don't think it has anything to do with mirror outdatedness, though"
2004-09-26T15:01:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"other than the download weirdness, .1 looks good"
2004-09-26T15:10:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"it's not that tcl8.0, gs, gs-gpl are out of date on little"
2004-09-26T15:10:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"yes, I was just noting that"
2004-09-26T15:10:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"they're not on the CD at all, and shouldn't need to be, but aptitude wants to install them for some reason"
2004-09-26T15:11:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,hmmm
2004-09-26T15:11:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,gs is in universe?!
2004-09-26T15:12:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"oh, we're using gs-esp"
2004-09-26T15:12:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"germinate bug, perhaps?"
2004-09-26T15:13:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"several packages depend on gs, and gs-esp provides gs"
2004-09-26T15:13:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,germinate's fine; looks like aptitude is wanting to install the first package in a |-ed list
2004-09-26T15:16:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,gs in main comes from the gs-gpl source
2004-09-26T15:16:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,you may vomit now
2004-09-26T16:06:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"so, fresh install from CD without taking updates from the network doesn't install tcl8.0,gs,gs-gpl and doesn't object to their absence"
2004-09-26T16:06:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,uncommenting those sources.list entries and doing update/upgrade seems fine too
2004-09-26T16:07:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,I conclude that aptitude is mad and we should not worry about it for preview
2004-09-26T16:08:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,agreed
2004-09-26T16:48:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,fixed gnome-vfs2 is built all around
2004-09-26T16:48:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,shall we roll a new CD?
2004-09-26T16:51:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,coming up
2004-09-26T05:15:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,Computer->Disks->right-click->unmount
2004-09-26T05:16:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,no unmount entry on the right-click menu
2004-09-26T05:16:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,really? works for me
2004-09-26T05:16:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,pumount /dev/foo should work at any rate
2004-09-26T05:16:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"I have 'Eject', not unmount"
2004-09-26T05:40:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,two weird things happened on powerpc just now
2004-09-26T05:40:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"archive-copier's progress bar was confused, and it ejected the CD"
2004-09-26T05:43:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"the progress bar's capped at about 75% at the moment; it's a bug, I know where it is"
2004-09-26T05:43:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,the CD eject is deliberate
2004-09-26T05:46:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,it takes ~1 second to fetch openssh-server from archive.u.c
2004-09-26T05:46:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,compared to 30 seconds or so to get the CD and insert it
2004-09-26T06:06:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,just installing it now
2004-09-26T06:20:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,works for me
2004-09-26T06:34:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"inetd should go away for hoary, likewise for mdadm (where you don't have raid devices)"
2004-09-26T06:36:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,we could just put mdadm in Ship and d-i would sort out installing it at the right times with no effort at all
2004-09-26T06:38:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"it used to, because of the particulars of Linux networking without an IP address"
2004-09-26T06:44:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,encoding/decoding UDP yourself sounds like asking for trouble
2004-09-26T06:44:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,agreed
2004-09-26T07:09:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,feel free ...
2004-09-26T07:09:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"although, yes, a find at the start would help, but there's only so fast it can go"
2004-09-26T07:52:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"I'd be tempted to drop /install/ for the preview, since there isn't a live CD"
2004-09-26T07:52:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,fine by me
2004-09-26T07:53:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,it is increasingly unlikely that we will have anything approaching a live CD corresponding to this release
2004-09-26T07:59:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,all clear to build the next (and hopefully last) CD
2004-09-26T08:14:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"for future optimization, powerpc should build first :-)"
2004-09-26T08:18:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"wouldn't matter anyway, they don't publish to the mirrors until all the architectures have built"
2004-09-26T08:36:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"damnit, you have way more bandwidth than I do"
2004-09-26T08:48:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,just noticed that archive-copier copies all the powerpc subarch kernels
2004-09-26T08:49:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"yes, I mentioned that a few days ago"
2004-09-26T08:49:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"they can't be yet, they rely on the images being in /releases/"
2004-09-26T08:50:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,the torrents have the location in them
2004-09-26T09:01:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,how's powerpc looking?
2004-09-27T12:27:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,have you seen Subject: Re: install instructions on the -users list?
2004-09-27T12:28:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"if you can review the text and make any necessary corrections, lu can integrate it"
2004-09-28T12:38:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,was python-mode one of the things we took out for some reason in that desktop seed blitz? I forget ...
2004-09-28T12:38:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,I don't think so; I didn't even know about it
2004-09-29T16:27:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,here?
2004-09-30T11:52:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,amd64 issues should go to Mithrandir
2004-09-30T11:54:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"heh, pass the buck :-)"
2004-10-01T09:47:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,are you up early or up late?
2004-10-01T09:47:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,late; just off to bed now ...
2004-10-01T09:47:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,you should know by now that I'm not one of these early-to-rise freaks ;)
2004-10-01T09:48:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,true
2004-10-02T05:51:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,I take it you don't feel like adding 64MB to the CD for the other kernels
2004-10-02T05:52:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"we have about 100M left, right?"
2004-10-02T05:52:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,there is a linux-source-*.deb though
2004-10-02T06:41:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,looks good to me
2004-10-02T05:55:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"rough back-of-an-envelope calculations say 125MB on amd64, 140MB on i386, 72MB on powerpc"
2004-10-02T05:55:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,remaining?
2004-10-02T05:55:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,yep
2004-10-02T05:55:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,eek
2004-10-02T05:57:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,it's held very steady for the last week; about 40MB lost since Sounder 8
2004-10-02T05:57:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"shame about not defaulting to NPTL if possible, mind"
2004-10-02T05:58:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"for Hoary we should have my new base-installer, which may let us be a little more flexible (e.g. include just the -686 kernel and have higher CPUs fall back down to it)"
2004-10-02T05:59:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,would you be willing to make a quick test CD if we move pcmcia-cs out to ShipSeed?
2004-10-02T05:59:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,sure
2004-10-02T05:59:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,I'd like to give it a run through
2004-10-02T05:59:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,would it be possible to it without tweaking the seeds as a trial? I seem to recall you had overrides of some sort
2004-10-02T06:00:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"not really as sophisticated as overrides, but I have a script ... :)"
2004-10-02T06:00:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"(hey, I could use germinate hints, couldn't I? that would be CLEVER.)"
2004-10-02T06:01:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,at some point we'll need to add documentation and suchlike
2004-10-02T06:01:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"speaking of, please beat me up until I do an installation manual branding job"
2004-10-02T06:05:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"hm, it's not a CD matter, I need a different debootstrap script to change Base"
2004-10-02T06:05:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,how about you install from an existing CD but edit pcmcia-cs out of /usr/lib/debootstrap/scripts/warty before debootstrap starts?
2004-10-02T06:05:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,I'll go and try that on my desktop amd64 now
2004-10-02T06:40:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,latest patch to #1337 includes bootloader configuration changes
2004-10-02T06:20:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,seems to correctly not install pcmcia-cs on a desktop
2004-10-02T06:42:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"if uploaded now, we could roll a test CD tomorrow with this and the pcmcia-cs changes, right?"
2004-10-02T06:44:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,can I also add acpi-modules to amd64 while I'm at it?
2004-10-02T06:45:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,certainly
2004-10-02T06:46:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"OK, starting uploads now"
2004-10-02T06:47:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,so does the daily CD build use the d-i build done earlier that day?  or one that you've blessed?
2004-10-02T06:48:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,it uses the daily build at the moment
2004-10-02T06:48:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"but it relies on elmo being awake to byhand it, so it's usually the previous day's build"
2004-10-08T15:58:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,back?
2004-10-11T05:32:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,also an ntfsresize hack was added to partman very recently
2004-10-11T06:10:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,good call
2004-10-13T07:09:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,that's American English
2004-10-24T10:59:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,"no, we don't do that either"
2004-10-24T11:00:00.000Z,Kamion,mdz,"don't we use -Wl,-O1? Jeff said we were using that everywhere"
2004-10-24T11:00:00.000Z,mdz,Kamion,some of the GNOME packages use it
