2005-06-25T13:03:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,so the chances of that are mitigated
2005-06-25T13:03:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,"but if the user is ignorant of the command, does it matter?"

2005-07-11T08:06:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,What parts of the Ubuntu guide are bad?
2005-07-11T08:07:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,"i don't have a list of 'bad' commands, but advising new users to enable non-official (and newly-official) repos for constant use is not good"

2005-07-11T08:08:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,ah. backports
2005-07-11T08:09:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,"while backports have been 'officialized', they still have not 'synced' fully, imho"
2005-07-11T08:11:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,the 'guide is more written for advanced linux users (who know what the commands are/do)
2005-07-11T08:12:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,omg
2005-07-11T08:12:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,how come?
2005-07-11T08:13:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,"correct, i see it more as a 'redhat/suse/gentoo > ubuntu/debian guide'"
2005-07-11T08:14:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,and some of plain out-n-out does not work
2005-07-11T08:15:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,"let me ask, how many New Users know if they have PPC, x86 or amd64 in their boxen?"

2005-07-11T08:23:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,new users are ignorant of that
2005-07-11T08:24:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,new users are especially at risk from ubuntuguide
2005-07-11T08:24:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,okay.....is the fud about backports true?
2005-07-11T08:25:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,"once backports has been more integrated into the ubuntu official process, there should be no stigma"
2005-07-11T08:25:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,"but for now and in the past, using BP constantly definitely would break your system"
2005-07-11T08:25:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,and any other unofficial repo
2005-07-11T08:26:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,never say never

2005-07-11T08:28:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,a long time
2005-07-11T08:28:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,how many users have you seen have to reinstall becuase of constant unofficial repo usage?

2005-07-11T09:39:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,what are the points?

2005-07-11T10:31:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,"<jasoncohen> kbrooks, why do you recommend that people install from backports and then remove the backports entry? if they do that they won't get any updates which is far worse than just using backports whole"
2005-07-11T10:32:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,"i dont advise removing the BP entry, just comment it out, because at the current time, prolonged use may cause system breakage in the future"
2005-07-11T10:32:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,"as has been pointed out, bp is official now, and will become more stable as time goes by"

2005-07-12T16:35:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,"if you're having video trouble and want productivity over acceleration, read what i've been discussing with vladuz976 and choose VESA also"
2005-07-12T16:35:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,"um, no. why should i choose vesa?"
2005-07-12T16:36:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,i dont understand
2005-07-12T16:36:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,is your nvidia driver working?

2005-07-12T16:43:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,would you rather see a gui so you can use firefox/xchat or whatever and attempt to find a solutin of why your NV makes blank screens?
2005-07-12T16:44:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,i think you are confused
2005-07-12T16:44:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,"wen i say nv, i dont mean nvidia"
2005-07-12T16:45:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,"i don't know the diff tween them, but VESA will get you a gui"

2005-07-14T08:04:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,a backup app ;)
2005-07-14T08:15:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,"colony is the code for breezy development, i believe"
2005-07-14T08:16:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,sure?
2005-07-14T08:16:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,"i believe it is (ie colony2, colony3, etc)"
2005-07-14T08:16:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,"if so, is the code in colony 'latest', as mojo claims it isnt?"
2005-07-14T08:28:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,"i think cedega-cvs is nonfree, by definition"
2005-07-14T08:28:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,of course it is
2005-07-14T08:28:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,but you can get it

2005-07-14T08:41:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,i dont think it could be done
2005-07-14T08:42:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,i heard that /usr is readonly
2005-07-14T08:42:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,"it can be done, you just lose your settings on reboot"
2005-07-14T08:43:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,should alien be recommendeeeeed to ANY ubuntu user?
2005-07-14T08:43:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,"tools are tools, they can be recommened with pros and cons and allow the user to make up their mind"
2005-07-14T08:44:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,there are some things only available in RPM (unfortunately)
2005-07-14T08:44:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,"you're right, but rpm is incompatible with debian/ubuntu"
2005-07-14T08:45:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,and that is what alien is for (if necessary)
2005-07-14T08:45:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,*I* have used alien once before...to convert a xawtv rpm to a xawtv debian format

2005-06-25T14:54:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,"all arer correct3, but........ ;)"
2005-06-25T14:54:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,windows is satan

2005-07-11T08:06:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,What parts of the Ubuntu guide are bad?
2005-07-11T08:07:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,"i don't have a list of 'bad' commands, but advising new users to enable non-official (and newly-official) repos for constant use is not good"

2005-07-11T08:08:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,ah. backports
2005-07-11T08:09:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,"while backports have been 'officialized', they still have not 'synced' fully, imho"
2005-07-11T08:11:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,the 'guide is more written for advanced linux users (who know what the commands are/do)
2005-07-11T08:12:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,omg
2005-07-11T08:12:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,how come?
2005-07-11T08:13:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,"correct, i see it more as a 'redhat/suse/gentoo > ubuntu/debian guide'"
2005-07-11T08:14:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,and some of plain out-n-out does not work
2005-07-11T08:15:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,"let me ask, how many New Users know if they have PPC, x86 or amd64 in their boxen?"
2005-07-11T08:15:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,yup

2005-07-11T08:23:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,new users are ignorant of that
2005-07-11T08:24:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,new users are especially at risk from ubuntuguide
2005-07-11T08:24:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,okay.....is the fud about backports true?
2005-07-11T08:25:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,"once backports has been more integrated into the ubuntu official process, there should be no stigma"
2005-07-11T08:25:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,"but for now and in the past, using BP constantly definitely would break your system"
2005-07-11T08:25:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,and any other unofficial repo
2005-07-11T08:26:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,never say never

2005-07-11T08:28:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,a long time
2005-07-11T08:28:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,how many users have you seen have to reinstall becuase of constant unofficial repo usage?

2005-07-11T08:31:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,get in there....please

2005-07-11T09:39:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,what are the points?

2005-07-11T10:31:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,"<jasoncohen> kbrooks, why do you recommend that people install from backports and then remove the backports entry? if they do that they won't get any updates which is far worse than just using backports whole"
2005-07-11T10:32:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,"i dont advise removing the BP entry, just comment it out, because at the current time, prolonged use may cause system breakage in the future"
2005-07-11T10:32:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,"as has been pointed out, bp is official now, and will become more stable as time goes by"

2005-07-12T16:35:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,"if you're having video trouble and want productivity over acceleration, read what i've been discussing with vladuz976 and choose VESA also"
2005-07-12T16:35:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,"um, no. why should i choose vesa?"
2005-07-12T16:36:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,i dont understand
2005-07-12T16:36:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,is your nvidia driver working?
2005-07-12T16:37:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,no. no screens found and nvidia api error

2005-07-12T16:42:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,"uh, yes"
2005-07-12T16:42:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,"if you are using the 'nv' driver NOW, it isnt working too well"

2005-07-12T16:43:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,would you rather see a gui so you can use firefox/xchat or whatever and attempt to find a solutin of why your NV makes blank screens?
2005-07-12T16:44:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,i think you are confused
2005-07-12T16:44:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,"wen i say nv, i dont mean nvidia"
2005-07-12T16:45:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,"i don't know the diff tween them, but VESA will get you a gui"
2005-07-12T16:45:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,you sure?

2005-07-14T08:04:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,a backup app ;)
2005-07-14T08:15:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,"colony is the code for breezy development, i believe"
2005-07-14T08:16:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,sure?
2005-07-14T08:16:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,"i believe it is (ie colony2, colony3, etc)"
2005-07-14T08:16:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,"if so, is the code in colony 'latest', as mojo claims it isnt?"
2005-07-14T08:28:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,"i think cedega-cvs is nonfree, by definition"
2005-07-14T08:28:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,of course it is
2005-07-14T08:28:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,but you can get it
2005-07-14T08:41:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,"it can be done, in memory"
2005-07-14T08:41:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,i dont think it could be done
2005-07-14T08:42:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,i heard that /usr is readonly
2005-07-14T08:42:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,"it can be done, you just lose your settings on reboot"
2005-07-14T08:43:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,should alien be recommendeeeeed to ANY ubuntu user?
2005-07-14T08:43:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,"tools are tools, they can be recommened with pros and cons and allow the user to make up their mind"
2005-07-14T08:44:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,there are some things only available in RPM (unfortunately)
2005-07-14T08:44:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,"you're right, but rpm is incompatible with debian/ubuntu"
2005-07-14T08:45:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,and that is what alien is for (if necessary)
2005-07-14T08:45:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,*I* have used alien once before...to convert a xawtv rpm to a xawtv debian format
2005-07-14T08:49:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,you are feeding
2005-07-15T08:34:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,oh fuck. shall i leave for a while?

2005-10-08T06:00:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,it's where you cant upgrade b/c you use non official repos and the pkgs are so different
2005-10-08T06:00:00.000Z,kbrooks,nalioth,versions?
2005-10-08T06:01:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,"if you use nonofficial repos, no thought is put into ubuntu upgrade compatibility"
2005-10-08T06:08:00.000Z,nalioth,kbrooks,yes?
