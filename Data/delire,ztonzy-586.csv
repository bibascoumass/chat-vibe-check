2005-04-19T13:08:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,"thanks, I met Jono Bacon at last years Blender Conference, very shortly we spoke, he tipped me about Ununtu then :D"

2005-04-24T14:11:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,hello ;)
2005-04-24T14:11:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,damn cold I caught :(
2005-04-24T14:12:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,i tried it some 5 years ago and haven't since.
2005-04-24T14:12:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,eeehh?
2005-04-24T14:12:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,wrong nick ;)
2005-04-24T14:12:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,lol
2005-04-24T14:12:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,sorry i dropped out last night. had to take my gf to the airport.
2005-04-24T14:12:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,aaah oh
2005-04-24T14:13:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,installed Ubuntu yesterday ....(gnome)
2005-04-24T14:15:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,how are you finding it?
2005-04-24T14:15:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,instead of Kubuntu ?
2005-04-24T14:15:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,yep
2005-04-24T14:16:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,set the 'draw while drag'  to false :)  so now I see this wire
2005-04-24T14:18:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,"hmm odd. well i don't use gnome or KDE here, so on the DE front i'm not very helpful. naturally #gnome could be a good place to resolve fiddly details."
2005-04-24T14:18:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,"but I dunno...it feels kde in kubuntu have some glitches still, I might be wrong, but I rather run a stable system than more experiment (sorrry for that, but I feel it like that)"
2005-04-24T14:18:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,true...will do it ....but my nose is dripping so much.... ack...
2005-04-24T14:19:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,"that's wise. as far as KDE distributions are concerned, there is nothing better than Mepis. i've just installed it on many machines and it is very solid."
2005-04-24T14:19:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,Ubuntu however really does pull off gnome very well.
2005-04-24T14:19:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,aha
2005-04-24T14:19:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,true
2005-04-24T14:20:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,you have seen art.gnome.org?
2005-04-24T14:20:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,"now and then yes, anything new ?"
2005-04-24T14:21:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,ahah ;)
2005-04-24T14:21:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,afterwards I knew who he is :D
2005-04-24T14:21:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,"for some weird reason, Blender Conferences drawn some of the most interesting people ! :)"
2005-04-24T14:22:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,it's an interesting application ;)
2005-04-24T14:22:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,the year before...do you know who were there and who I by chance shook hands with :O ?
2005-04-24T14:22:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,;)
2005-04-24T14:22:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,..? ;)
2005-04-24T14:22:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,Mark Shuttleworth =O
2005-04-24T14:23:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,hehe...had a shot chat with him...he didnt even say he had been up to space!
2005-04-24T14:23:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,whole blender coders jawdropped the week after
2005-04-24T14:24:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,and why was he at the blender conference?
2005-04-24T14:25:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,he talked about Python and the work along with Blender
2005-04-24T14:25:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,so he works with blender does he?
2005-04-24T14:25:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,what I know is that he like that language
2005-04-24T14:25:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,the Python API for blender is excellent. i was revisiting it again today.
2005-04-24T14:25:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,maybe...dont remember...but I wouldnt be surprised
2005-04-24T14:26:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,"aah...I dont know much about python, maybe I am lazy or just stupid artist"
2005-04-24T14:26:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,follow your interests ;)
2005-04-24T14:27:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,true

2005-04-26T13:03:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,"not really, just dropped in to see how the most popular Desktop Distro of linux is going ;)"
2005-04-26T13:03:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,hehe :)
2005-04-26T13:03:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,"btw,,,how does the game development go for you ?"
2005-04-26T13:04:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,"good, today working alot with http://ogre3d.org"
2005-04-26T13:04:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,aah..mostly coding ? some 3D work ?
2005-04-26T13:05:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,"today coding work, but only so that i can get models and events setup in the game engine"
2005-04-26T13:06:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,nice...can I ask what it is for ?
2005-04-26T13:06:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,for a MMORPG project here at the itu.dk
2005-04-26T13:06:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,great!
2005-04-26T14:13:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,or any linux ;)
2005-04-26T14:13:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,well not this machine ;)
2005-04-26T14:13:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,how fast ?
2005-04-26T14:13:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,about 16 seconds
2005-04-26T14:13:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,awsome
2005-04-26T14:13:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,though if i'm looking for an IP then it's slower.
2005-04-26T14:13:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,aha
2005-04-26T14:20:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,you can run openbox (a great light window manager) in gnome. that will speed things up alot.
2005-04-26T14:20:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,aah ?
2005-04-26T14:21:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,i'll find the link. it's a great window manager. http://icculus.org/openbox/2/
2005-04-26T14:23:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,you can do some very nice things with the text and rendering in openbox http://icculus.org/openbox/2/shots/full/mwil-sshot.png
2005-04-26T14:25:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,"aah ok...but about tools , menus etc ???"
2005-04-26T14:26:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,"well it just picks up the debian menu. you can use gnome, however. so you have the gnome panel, gnome menu and gnome tools but just use a wm much faster and lighter than metacity/sawfish"
2005-04-26T14:27:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,ah yes...metacity feels slow
2005-04-26T14:28:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,apt-get install openbox and then to try 'killall <yourwindowmanager> && openbox' in a terminal
2005-04-26T14:28:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,it will be dramatic for a second or two ;)
2005-04-26T14:28:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,thanks mr expert ! :D
2005-04-26T14:28:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,i try..
2005-04-26T14:28:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,what about open apps and windows ?
2005-04-26T14:29:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,they /*should*/ accept the new wm and not die like lambs..
2005-04-26T14:29:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,ah ok :)
2005-04-26T14:29:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,logout and back in again..
2005-04-26T14:30:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,does gnome have 'sticky notes' ?
2005-04-26T14:30:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,aah...the command to try...but it isnt default....until ???
2005-04-26T14:30:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,hmm not sure. that's one nice treat about KDE
2005-04-26T14:33:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,"hold on tight, here we go ! :)"
2005-04-26T14:33:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,wow !
2005-04-26T14:34:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,it went faster than a second !
2005-04-26T14:34:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,hehe cool
2005-04-26T14:34:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,how does it look?
2005-04-26T14:34:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,tiney borders...but feels slick resizing
2005-04-26T14:35:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,you can alt-leftmousedrag and move the window around
2005-04-26T14:36:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,yes just like any other
2005-04-26T14:54:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,you can however create those files and then enter the above line. 'touch .xinitrc' && echo 'exec openbox' >> .xinitrc'
2005-04-26T14:55:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,thanks
2005-04-26T15:16:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,how's openbox looking?
2005-04-26T15:16:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,as I said...clean and slick
2005-04-26T15:16:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,but I would like to able to change modifier key
2005-04-26T15:17:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,also...windows opens faster now
2005-04-26T15:24:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,installed and runs
2005-04-26T15:24:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,great!
2005-04-26T15:24:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,is it alot faster?
2005-04-26T15:24:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,dunoo yet...but now the mouse+modifier key is better ;)
2005-04-26T15:25:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,hit ALT-mousewheel in a window and drag
2005-04-26T15:26:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,that's Zbuffer ordere
2005-04-26T15:27:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,hmm well i can't remember what the resize button is. use a text editor to view .config/openbox/rc.xml or similar all the bindings are in there
2005-04-26T15:28:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,also install obconf the openbox configurator
2005-04-26T15:28:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,"aah, it is RMB"
2005-04-26T15:28:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,hard for me to remember the shortcuts ..

2005-04-26T15:31:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,hehe ok..
2005-04-26T15:31:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,no i don't think so..

2005-04-26T15:32:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,use whatever you like.

2005-04-27T16:32:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,:|
2005-04-27T16:32:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,why that face ?
2005-04-27T16:32:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,so you like it?
2005-04-27T16:32:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,much bette than metacity
2005-04-27T16:33:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,yepp
2005-04-27T16:33:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,i switched because of both terminal work and modelling in blender.
2005-04-27T16:33:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,you use now?
2005-04-27T16:37:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,"why don't you ensure fazer has your same setup? he has an ~/.xsession file that he might want to remove and perhaps mirror what you have in ~/.xinitrc. i get the feeling he wants a bit of gnome and openbox, like you (a sensible choice)."
2005-04-27T16:38:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,yes...
2005-04-27T16:39:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,you guide him ?
2005-04-27T16:40:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,he is too fast for us
2005-04-27T16:41:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,he'll come back completely lost ;)
2005-04-27T16:42:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,hahaha
2005-04-27T16:42:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,: hehe told you
2005-04-27T16:43:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,he should be more gentle and have more patience
2005-04-27T16:44:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,"have conviced my sister to install Linux instead of Win98 on her comp, problem is...she wont get adsl and she uses 56k modem that is badly supported...I know, I tried !"
2005-04-27T16:45:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,hmm if it's an external modem it's usually ok.
2005-04-27T16:45:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,not it isnt...my Lasat 56k flex....didnt work as it should either even if it was detected and did the dial
2005-04-27T16:45:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,i know that the non-freeish Mepis has support for a whole bunch of evil internal winmodems.
2005-04-27T16:45:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,ahah
2005-04-27T16:46:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,it is weird
2005-04-27T16:47:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,heh
2005-04-27T16:47:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,so now I dont know how to solve it...it seems as the ISP doesnt like the commands...
2005-04-27T16:48:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,"hmm, i'd take thoreauputic's advice and buy her an external in a bunch of..... daffodils"
2005-04-27T16:49:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,uuuuh ?  I already have a external modem...my own lasat
2005-04-27T16:49:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,you could use the usb cable from the external modem to tie the flowers in a bunch.
2005-04-27T16:49:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,hmmm you mean a new USB phonemodem would work better than an old lasatmodem ?
2005-04-27T16:50:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,usb modems work well in linux generally speaking.
2005-04-27T16:50:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,though if the modem is detected but you can't connect your ISP then of course check the dial options and user/pw
2005-04-27T16:51:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,user/pw is corrcet
2005-04-27T16:52:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,"you're right, i used wvdial back in the day to get mine up and running. thankfully those times are over."
2005-04-27T16:52:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,can you tip any good model/brand ?
2005-04-27T16:52:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,well if your serial modem is working don't touch it
2005-04-27T16:53:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,it is detected instantly by Ubuntu...problem is however the settings for the ISP...dunno how to fix those
2005-04-27T16:53:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,thoreauputic makes me feel like i've been lucky with usb modems.
2005-04-27T16:54:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,pulse/tone dialing?
2005-04-27T16:54:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,hmmm tone I guess?  cant remember the differences
2005-04-30T13:21:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,evening :)
2005-04-30T13:22:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,hola

2005-05-16T14:14:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,"fine thanks...back to gnome...but maybe I already told you that...and also , tweaking my character I showed you before"
2005-05-16T14:15:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,ahah great.

2005-05-16T14:21:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,"my brother did that today, pinnacle"
2005-05-16T14:22:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,hmm.. well many seem to be perfectly linux compatible.
2005-05-16T14:22:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,what's the DKK to SEK these days?
2005-05-16T14:22:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,"tell what which you get next time...I have also been thinking of it, even though I got tv less than 2 metres to the right ;)"
2005-05-16T14:23:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,about 1.25 I think  ( DKK more worth than SEK)
2005-05-16T14:23:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,hmm..
2005-05-16T14:43:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,"sorry , been away for a few minutes...had some troubles over at elYsiun :-\"

2005-04-19T13:07:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,"used Fedora, shortly debian, then Ubuntu,  had some issues filesystem errors+network...concluded it was my mainboard...so used XP during two mpnths"
2005-04-19T13:07:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,you made a good choice (either this or Mepis)..

2005-04-24T14:12:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,aaah oh
2005-04-24T14:13:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,installed Ubuntu yesterday ....(gnome)
2005-04-24T14:15:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,how are you finding it?
2005-04-24T14:15:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,instead of Kubuntu ?
2005-04-24T14:15:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,yep
2005-04-24T14:16:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,set the 'draw while drag'  to false :)  so now I see this wire
2005-04-24T14:18:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,"hmm odd. well i don't use gnome or KDE here, so on the DE front i'm not very helpful. naturally #gnome could be a good place to resolve fiddly details."
2005-04-24T14:18:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,"but I dunno...it feels kde in kubuntu have some glitches still, I might be wrong, but I rather run a stable system than more experiment (sorrry for that, but I feel it like that)"
2005-04-24T14:18:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,true...will do it ....but my nose is dripping so much.... ack...
2005-04-24T14:19:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,"that's wise. as far as KDE distributions are concerned, there is nothing better than Mepis. i've just installed it on many machines and it is very solid."
2005-04-24T14:19:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,Ubuntu however really does pull off gnome very well.
2005-04-24T14:19:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,aha
2005-04-24T14:19:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,true
2005-04-24T14:20:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,you have seen art.gnome.org?
2005-04-24T14:20:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,"now and then yes, anything new ?"
2005-04-24T14:21:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,ahah ;)
2005-04-24T14:21:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,afterwards I knew who he is :D
2005-04-24T14:21:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,"for some weird reason, Blender Conferences drawn some of the most interesting people ! :)"
2005-04-24T14:22:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,it's an interesting application ;)
2005-04-24T14:22:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,the year before...do you know who were there and who I by chance shook hands with :O ?
2005-04-24T14:22:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,;)
2005-04-24T14:22:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,..? ;)
2005-04-24T14:22:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,Mark Shuttleworth =O
2005-04-24T14:23:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,hehe...had a shot chat with him...he didnt even say he had been up to space!
2005-04-24T14:23:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,whole blender coders jawdropped the week after
2005-04-24T14:24:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,and why was he at the blender conference?
2005-04-24T14:25:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,he talked about Python and the work along with Blender
2005-04-24T14:25:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,so he works with blender does he?
2005-04-24T14:25:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,what I know is that he like that language
2005-04-24T14:25:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,the Python API for blender is excellent. i was revisiting it again today.
2005-04-24T14:25:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,maybe...dont remember...but I wouldnt be surprised
2005-04-24T14:26:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,"aah...I dont know much about python, maybe I am lazy or just stupid artist"
2005-04-24T14:26:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,follow your interests ;)
2005-04-24T14:27:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,true

2005-04-26T13:02:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,hi there ;)
2005-04-26T13:02:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,so you are here helping out ? :)
2005-04-26T13:03:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,"not really, just dropped in to see how the most popular Desktop Distro of linux is going ;)"
2005-04-26T13:03:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,hehe :)
2005-04-26T13:03:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,"btw,,,how does the game development go for you ?"
2005-04-26T13:04:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,"good, today working alot with http://ogre3d.org"
2005-04-26T13:04:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,aah..mostly coding ? some 3D work ?
2005-04-26T13:05:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,"today coding work, but only so that i can get models and events setup in the game engine"
2005-04-26T13:06:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,nice...can I ask what it is for ?
2005-04-26T13:06:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,for a MMORPG project here at the itu.dk
2005-04-26T13:06:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,great!
2005-04-26T14:13:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,or any linux ;)
2005-04-26T14:13:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,well not this machine ;)
2005-04-26T14:13:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,how fast ?
2005-04-26T14:13:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,about 16 seconds
2005-04-26T14:13:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,awsome
2005-04-26T14:13:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,though if i'm looking for an IP then it's slower.
2005-04-26T14:13:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,aha
2005-04-26T14:20:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,you can run openbox (a great light window manager) in gnome. that will speed things up alot.
2005-04-26T14:20:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,aah ?
2005-04-26T14:21:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,i'll find the link. it's a great window manager. http://icculus.org/openbox/2/
2005-04-26T14:23:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,you can do some very nice things with the text and rendering in openbox http://icculus.org/openbox/2/shots/full/mwil-sshot.png
2005-04-26T14:25:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,"aah ok...but about tools , menus etc ???"
2005-04-26T14:26:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,"well it just picks up the debian menu. you can use gnome, however. so you have the gnome panel, gnome menu and gnome tools but just use a wm much faster and lighter than metacity/sawfish"
2005-04-26T14:27:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,ah yes...metacity feels slow
2005-04-26T14:28:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,apt-get install openbox and then to try 'killall <yourwindowmanager> && openbox' in a terminal
2005-04-26T14:28:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,it will be dramatic for a second or two ;)
2005-04-26T14:28:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,thanks mr expert ! :D
2005-04-26T14:28:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,i try..
2005-04-26T14:28:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,what about open apps and windows ?
2005-04-26T14:29:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,they /*should*/ accept the new wm and not die like lambs..
2005-04-26T14:29:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,ah ok :)
2005-04-26T14:29:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,logout and back in again..
2005-04-26T14:30:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,does gnome have 'sticky notes' ?
2005-04-26T14:30:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,aah...the command to try...but it isnt default....until ???
2005-04-26T14:30:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,hmm not sure. that's one nice treat about KDE
2005-04-26T14:33:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,"hold on tight, here we go ! :)"
2005-04-26T14:33:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,wow !
2005-04-26T14:34:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,it went faster than a second !
2005-04-26T14:34:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,hehe cool
2005-04-26T14:34:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,how does it look?
2005-04-26T14:34:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,tiney borders...but feels slick resizing
2005-04-26T14:35:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,you can alt-leftmousedrag and move the window around
2005-04-26T14:36:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,yes just like any other
2005-04-26T14:54:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,you can however create those files and then enter the above line. 'touch .xinitrc' && echo 'exec openbox' >> .xinitrc'
2005-04-26T14:55:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,thanks
2005-04-26T15:16:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,how's openbox looking?
2005-04-26T15:16:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,as I said...clean and slick
2005-04-26T15:16:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,but I would like to able to change modifier key
2005-04-26T15:17:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,also...windows opens faster now
2005-04-26T15:24:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,installed and runs
2005-04-26T15:24:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,great!
2005-04-26T15:24:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,is it alot faster?
2005-04-26T15:24:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,dunoo yet...but now the mouse+modifier key is better ;)
2005-04-26T15:25:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,hit ALT-mousewheel in a window and drag
2005-04-26T15:26:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,that's Zbuffer ordere
2005-04-26T15:27:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,hmm well i can't remember what the resize button is. use a text editor to view .config/openbox/rc.xml or similar all the bindings are in there
2005-04-26T15:28:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,also install obconf the openbox configurator
2005-04-26T15:28:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,"aah, it is RMB"
2005-04-26T15:28:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,hard for me to remember the shortcuts ..
2005-04-26T15:29:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,but this wasnt for waimeia ?
2005-04-26T15:30:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,is there also a for waimaea as for openbox ?
2005-04-26T15:31:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,it's for openbox
2005-04-26T15:31:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,but now I use waimea
2005-04-26T15:31:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,hehe ok..
2005-04-26T15:31:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,no i don't think so..
2005-04-26T15:31:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,but I can switch back
2005-04-26T15:32:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,use whatever you like.
2005-04-26T15:43:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,is there any menutool for openbox ?
2005-04-27T16:26:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,already a fan
2005-04-27T16:26:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,hehe
2005-04-27T16:26:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,thanks for help
2005-04-27T16:27:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,no problem
2005-04-27T16:32:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,:|
2005-04-27T16:32:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,why that face ?
2005-04-27T16:32:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,so you like it?
2005-04-27T16:32:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,much bette than metacity
2005-04-27T16:33:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,yepp
2005-04-27T16:33:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,i switched because of both terminal work and modelling in blender.
2005-04-27T16:33:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,you use now?
2005-04-27T16:37:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,"why don't you ensure fazer has your same setup? he has an ~/.xsession file that he might want to remove and perhaps mirror what you have in ~/.xinitrc. i get the feeling he wants a bit of gnome and openbox, like you (a sensible choice)."
2005-04-27T16:38:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,yes...
2005-04-27T16:39:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,you guide him ?
2005-04-27T16:40:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,he is too fast for us
2005-04-27T16:41:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,he'll come back completely lost ;)
2005-04-27T16:42:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,hahaha
2005-04-27T16:42:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,: hehe told you
2005-04-27T16:43:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,he should be more gentle and have more patience
2005-04-27T16:44:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,"have conviced my sister to install Linux instead of Win98 on her comp, problem is...she wont get adsl and she uses 56k modem that is badly supported...I know, I tried !"
2005-04-27T16:45:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,hmm if it's an external modem it's usually ok.
2005-04-27T16:45:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,not it isnt...my Lasat 56k flex....didnt work as it should either even if it was detected and did the dial
2005-04-27T16:45:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,i know that the non-freeish Mepis has support for a whole bunch of evil internal winmodems.
2005-04-27T16:45:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,ahah
2005-04-27T16:46:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,it is weird
2005-04-27T16:47:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,heh
2005-04-27T16:47:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,so now I dont know how to solve it...it seems as the ISP doesnt like the commands...
2005-04-27T16:48:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,"hmm, i'd take thoreauputic's advice and buy her an external in a bunch of..... daffodils"
2005-04-27T16:49:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,uuuuh ?  I already have a external modem...my own lasat
2005-04-27T16:49:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,you could use the usb cable from the external modem to tie the flowers in a bunch.
2005-04-27T16:49:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,hmmm you mean a new USB phonemodem would work better than an old lasatmodem ?
2005-04-27T16:50:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,usb modems work well in linux generally speaking.
2005-04-27T16:50:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,though if the modem is detected but you can't connect your ISP then of course check the dial options and user/pw
2005-04-27T16:51:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,user/pw is corrcet
2005-04-27T16:52:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,"you're right, i used wvdial back in the day to get mine up and running. thankfully those times are over."
2005-04-27T16:52:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,can you tip any good model/brand ?
2005-04-27T16:52:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,well if your serial modem is working don't touch it
2005-04-27T16:53:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,it is detected instantly by Ubuntu...problem is however the settings for the ISP...dunno how to fix those
2005-04-27T16:53:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,thoreauputic makes me feel like i've been lucky with usb modems.
2005-04-27T16:54:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,pulse/tone dialing?
2005-04-27T16:54:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,hmmm tone I guess?  cant remember the differences
2005-04-30T13:21:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,evening :)
2005-04-30T13:22:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,hola
2005-04-30T13:23:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,back to metacity
2005-04-30T13:24:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,hehe ok
2005-05-13T10:13:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,:)
2005-05-16T14:14:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,:)
2005-05-16T14:14:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,"fine thanks...back to gnome...but maybe I already told you that...and also , tweaking my character I showed you before"
2005-05-16T14:15:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,ahah great.
2005-05-16T14:16:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,I can show a bit later when I have done some nice updates
2005-05-16T14:16:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,yeah do that.. i'd be interested
2005-05-16T14:17:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,great! :D    I also bought & watched 'The Incredibles' DVD today
2005-05-16T14:18:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,and how was it?
2005-05-16T14:20:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,damn funny :)
2005-05-16T14:20:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,now I know why character shall not have a cape ;)
2005-05-16T14:20:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,"i'm considering buying a tv card, somewhat out-of-the-media-loop lately."
2005-05-16T14:20:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,ahah ;)
2005-05-16T14:21:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,tv card ?
2005-05-16T14:21:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,"yes, for my laptop. so i can watch TV on my box."
2005-05-16T14:21:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,s/box/computer
2005-05-16T14:21:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,"my brother did that today, pinnacle"
2005-05-16T14:22:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,hmm.. well many seem to be perfectly linux compatible.
2005-05-16T14:22:00.000Z,delire,ztonzy,what's the DKK to SEK these days?
2005-05-16T14:22:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,"tell what which you get next time...I have also been thinking of it, even though I got tv less than 2 metres to the right ;)"
2005-05-16T14:23:00.000Z,ztonzy,delire,about 1.25 I think  ( DKK more worth than SEK)
