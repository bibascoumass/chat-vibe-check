2005-07-02T12:18:00.000Z,Seveas,ompaul,it's not really clear what you mean...
2005-07-02T12:21:00.000Z,ompaul,Seveas,"using that system,admin,printing menu option, would users benefit from the following options (A) configure printing (B) being able to try to print test page (C) use last know good value settings for printer {in case something had fallen over} (D) if for the users printer their machine used the USB system be in a position to kill it off and restart it?"
