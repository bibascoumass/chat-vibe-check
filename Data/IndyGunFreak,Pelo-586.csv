2008-05-01T05:40:00.000Z,IndyGunFreak,Pelo,"hmm, i'll hvave to mess w/ it."
2008-05-01T06:01:00.000Z,Pelo,IndyGunFreak," he's running  nvidia-config adn settings, he should try to adjust the horiz sync from there"
2008-05-01T06:02:00.000Z,IndyGunFreak,Pelo,"problem is, when he tries to do that before nvidia driver is enabled, ... it says it can't because the driver isn't enabled.. but when he restarst, it shows him out of range"
2008-05-01T06:03:00.000Z,Pelo,IndyGunFreak, nvidia-settings is cli no ?
2008-05-01T06:03:00.000Z,IndyGunFreak,Pelo,"not that i know, it might run in cli, but i don't think so.. i thought it wsa a gui program"
2008-05-01T06:04:00.000Z,Pelo,IndyGunFreak,"I think that the monitor might still be driven by xorg.conf,  just keep him in recovery /cli a and have him adjust the horzsync  line from there"
2008-05-01T06:04:00.000Z,IndyGunFreak,Pelo,"in xorg, or in nvidia-settings?.."
2008-05-01T06:05:00.000Z,Pelo,IndyGunFreak,"in xorg.conf     devide MONITOR ,  Horizsync   38-59 or someitng,  make him do it so it matches the label on the back of the monitor"
2008-05-01T06:05:00.000Z,IndyGunFreak,Pelo,"hmm, never had to do that before"
2008-05-01T06:07:00.000Z,Pelo,IndyGunFreak,"that's why he's getting out of range,   the setting being sent it too low for the refresh rate the monitor needs for that resolution"
2008-05-01T06:07:00.000Z,IndyGunFreak,Pelo,i think i understand now.
2008-05-01T06:15:00.000Z,IndyGunFreak,Pelo,"now thats weird, i don't have a 'Device' monitor"
2008-05-01T06:16:00.000Z,Pelo,IndyGunFreak,let me double check

2008-05-01T06:16:00.000Z,Pelo,IndyGunFreak,"my msitake ,  section monitor"
2008-05-01T06:17:00.000Z,IndyGunFreak,Pelo,"what if he added a range there, like 'Horizsync 30-96'"
2008-05-01T06:18:00.000Z,Pelo,IndyGunFreak,"he should realy check his monitor specks,  going too hight is just as bad"
2008-05-01T06:19:00.000Z,IndyGunFreak,Pelo,"yeah, but he says the specs aren't on the monitor"
2008-05-01T06:19:00.000Z,Pelo,IndyGunFreak,"google then,   maker website"
2008-05-01T06:19:00.000Z,IndyGunFreak,Pelo,"yeah, i think thats what he'll have to do."
2008-05-01T06:23:00.000Z,IndyGunFreak,Pelo,i think so..
2008-08-14T05:57:00.000Z,IndyGunFreak,Pelo,oh noeeezzz
