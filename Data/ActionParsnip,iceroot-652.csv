2009-04-16T16:11:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,thats not using 3d glasses
2009-04-16T16:12:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,i have not seen his second line
2009-04-17T15:19:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,crank all the sliders up
2009-04-17T15:19:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,or buy a preamp ;)
2009-04-17T15:19:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,all up and i dont want to use a preamp on my eeepc
2009-04-17T15:20:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,i'm pretty sure the speaker in an eepc will be fairly poor
2009-04-17T15:21:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,on windows its much loader then on ubuntu
2009-04-17T15:21:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,so i think its a software-problem
2009-04-17T15:22:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,try a different driver or different driver settings
2009-06-24T14:11:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"same deal, yours is quicker"
2009-06-24T14:11:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,i think so :)
2009-06-24T14:12:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,i bet theres even a klingon pack (some sad loser will have made it)
2009-06-24T14:13:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"yes, i have seen it"
2009-06-24T14:16:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,more often is ubunto
2009-06-24T14:17:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,:) also they asked for wlan-cable?
2009-06-26T16:28:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,normal ubuntu also using PAE in he kernel?
2009-06-26T16:28:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"afaik, no"
2009-07-09T12:18:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,s/pure/--purge
2009-07-09T12:18:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"yeah, thx"
2009-07-23T13:42:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,simple isn't it .. ;)
2009-07-23T13:42:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,i thought it is... :)
2009-07-23T13:45:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,you are to fast for me :)
2009-07-23T13:45:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,i use cli mostly dude ;)
2009-07-23T13:46:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"same here but it is early in the morning, so i am sleeping a little bit, that is your advantage"
2009-07-26T00:09:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,there is on action you need a real root (with eraly ubuntu-version)
2009-07-26T00:09:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"if you boot and fsck will repair the drive, it ask for the root-password"
2009-07-26T00:13:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,the bootup process is all as root so shuld not ask for a passowrd
2009-07-26T00:14:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"an early ubuntu-version was asking this, dont know  the version anymore"
2009-07-26T00:14:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,lsb_release -c will tell you
2009-07-26T00:15:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"no, i mean that years ago i was using a version which was asking for the root-password .)"
2009-07-26T00:16:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,weird
2009-09-05T23:33:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,the apps will be compiled for 64bit systems so will be fully 64bit
2009-09-05T23:33:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,thank you
2009-09-11T01:48:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"xlsx is not proprietary, its zipped xml"
2009-09-11T01:49:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,nice
2009-09-11T01:49:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"like docx, its also zipped xml, he old format doc,xls and so on are proprietary"
2009-09-11T01:50:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,every day is a school day
2009-09-11T01:51:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,that is the interessing part of computers
2009-09-11T01:51:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,definately :D
2009-09-30T16:59:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"make compiles the source with the config from configure, make install is the only step needing root (assuming you are compiling in your own home folder) as you will be writing to where you dont have write access"
2009-09-30T17:00:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"so i only need root because it wants to access /etc/ and so on. if i say, use /home for the installation, i dont need root?"
2009-09-30T17:01:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"correct, the make you can do as yourself provided you have write access where you are compiling"
2009-09-30T17:02:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"thank you alot, then i will do some 'make' instead of 'apt-get' to learn more about it. (its just a test-vm)"
2009-09-30T17:03:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,if the package is on the repo you can apt-get it
2009-09-30T17:03:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,ifconfig
2009-09-30T17:03:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"it is i just want to learn to build something from source, its just for testing in a vm"
2009-09-30T17:04:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,no harm in that at all :D
2009-09-30T17:05:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,i was also successfull with building my first *.deb  it was a litte pythonscript and now i can install it with dpkg -i myfile.deb :)
2009-09-30T17:05:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"nice, wtg :)"
2009-10-14T16:54:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"i find it smoother, not really faster"
2009-10-14T16:55:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,http://download.macromedia.com/pub/labs/flashplayer10/libflashplayer-10.0.32.18.linux-x86_64.so.tar.gz
2009-10-14T16:56:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,thx
2009-10-14T16:56:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,can you /msg me that link? i am at work and cant save that link
2009-10-14T16:56:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,uninstall the flashplugin package and put thet in your plugins dir (or you can put it in ~/.mozilla/plugins
2009-10-15T14:58:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,flash is working better (but not perfect) on amd64 :)
2009-11-05T17:18:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,you can display the dhcp clients in the server usually
2009-11-05T17:19:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"that client will not get an ip, because the mac is nowhere, so the real reason i want to see the dhcp-asking task is to get the mac-adress of that client"
2009-11-05T17:20:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,use arp then
2009-11-05T17:20:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,the client is a NAS
2009-11-05T17:21:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,still has an IP and MAC so should respond to ARP
2009-11-05T17:21:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,unless its configured not to respond to it
2009-11-05T17:22:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"it has no ip, this network dhcp only gives ips to known mac adresses"
2009-11-05T17:22:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,so i need that mac-adress
2009-11-05T17:22:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,and with the dhcp-asking there should be the mac-adress
2009-11-05T17:22:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,i tink you will have to attend the NAS physically then
2009-11-05T17:22:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,otherwise i am unsure
2009-11-05T17:24:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,its not a good idea because i am on a thin client and cant use a peer-to-peer-connection with the NAS because i will loosing contact to terminal-server
2009-11-11T16:17:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,gotcha
2009-11-12T17:05:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,ifconfig
2009-11-12T17:06:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,and what is the parameter? have not found anything
2009-11-12T17:07:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,usually says in that output the speed its running
2009-11-12T17:07:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,not here
2009-11-26T15:49:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,its getting ubuntu booted though
2009-11-26T15:50:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,?
2009-11-26T15:50:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,i thouht you were gonna kick him over to ##windows ;)
2009-11-26T15:50:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"yes, thats normally my job here :)"
2009-11-26T15:51:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,can we start a 'wubi needs to burn and should be scrapped' petition
2009-11-26T15:51:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"never used wubi, so i dont know if it is a bad thing"
2009-11-26T15:56:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,mounted partition remember ;)
2009-11-26T15:57:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,live-cd is automounting (if i am correct)
2009-11-26T15:57:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,sure but under /media   /boot is in the live CD environment
2009-11-26T16:00:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,":( yes, you are right"
2009-11-26T16:01:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,got your back bro
2009-12-01T01:38:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,but not the one from vlc :)  good evenning dude
2009-12-01T01:40:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,howdy
2009-12-01T01:40:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,mplayer is one of the oldest and respected players around
2009-12-01T01:43:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,but if i am correct mplayer dont have own codecs like vlc
2009-12-01T01:43:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"sure it doesm, it installs what it needs to run"
2009-12-01T01:44:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,codecs are universal too so all players can use the codecs if they are installed :)
2009-12-01T01:45:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,thats correct but vlc comes with some nice codecs (other apps not using)
2009-12-01T01:46:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,not had an issue personally
2009-12-01T01:47:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,try some nonfree things without a distribution which has ubuntu-restrcited-extras
2009-12-28T16:01:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,a browser ;)
2009-12-28T16:01:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,a garbage browser too ;)
2009-12-28T16:02:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,you can name a better oss browser?
2009-12-28T16:02:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,chromium   easily
2009-12-28T16:02:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,its a chrome-forke isnt it?
2009-12-28T16:02:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,its a bleeding edge chrome
2009-12-28T16:02:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,with addblock?
2009-12-28T16:03:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"i installed it today, yes"
2009-12-28T16:03:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,maybe i will have a look. i will trust your mind :)
2009-12-29T19:24:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,they will have backups AFTER the first crash
2009-12-29T19:25:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"true, same they have to lear the hardest way"
2009-12-29T19:25:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,sure
2009-12-29T19:29:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,they dont
2009-12-29T19:29:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"didnt think so, apple are morons"
2010-01-03T03:35:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,i am to slow for you :(
2010-02-15T23:40:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,may have to add a command to uninstall adobe-flashplugin
2010-02-15T23:40:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,why uninstall?
2010-02-15T23:41:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,ah yes
2010-03-06T13:05:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,crossover is imo a patched version
2010-03-06T13:05:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,but never looked at crossover
2010-03-06T13:06:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,just reading some articles and bug-reports
2010-03-06T13:08:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"of course, because it is wine but the focus is imo on ms office"
2010-03-17T14:22:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,only shebang (perl)
2010-03-17T14:22:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,cheers dude
2010-04-24T08:20:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,put !slow on your clipboard ;)
2010-04-24T08:24:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"yes, that is another reason"
2010-06-08T23:27:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"if you dont like firefox, try iceweasel :)"
2010-06-26T22:23:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"ok, never looked at it"
2010-06-26T22:24:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,dk: http://www.ubuntugeek.com/enable-ctrl-alt-backspace-in-ubuntukubuntu-10-04lucid-lynx.html
2010-07-10T11:13:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"i'd say a lot of others are equally easy, ubuntu just seems to make the most noise"
2010-07-10T11:14:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"the others dont have nice tools  for installing restricted things, mostly the dont have a metapackage, also they are using old software (lenny)"
2010-07-10T11:15:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"depends no the distro, gentoo has some awesomeness and emerge is great"
2010-07-10T11:15:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,i dont think a 'newbie' want a rolling release distri basd on source-code
2010-07-10T11:16:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"its just a different way to manage a distro, suse and mandriva are also as easy imho"
2010-07-10T11:17:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,apt-get > yast
2010-07-10T11:17:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,al works equally fine here
2010-07-10T11:21:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"you have distris which dont want to use nonfree firmware, nonfree drivers and so on (debian) so its hard for beginners to get hardware working, ubuntu doesnt care much about that 'everything has to be free'"
2010-08-05T00:27:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,i am just posting a text from debian without my personal opinion
2010-08-05T00:28:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,gotcha
2011-03-03T20:15:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,dude its 1200 lines
2011-03-03T20:16:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,could get a pm instead....
2011-03-03T20:17:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,Pici of course i mean he should post the pastebin link to mainchat not the content
2011-03-12T03:23:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,i dont think he will make a backup first and in 10 minutes he tells he lost all his data
2011-03-12T03:24:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,most don't. I have my sign ready :)
2011-03-12T03:27:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,people like to learn the hard way :(
2011-03-28T19:29:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,its fixed now
2011-03-28T19:31:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,but webmin is not a good way to edit configs and he asked about a good gui program
2011-03-28T19:31:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"a good gui-application for working with configs is gvim, emacs or gedit"
2011-03-28T19:43:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"webmin is a gui, just accesses via a web browser..."
2011-03-28T19:44:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,and writing config-files
2011-03-28T19:44:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"like yast, plesk and other tools from the hell do"
2011-05-05T00:14:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,add -C too (enables compression)
2011-06-03T10:38:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,ksplice
2011-06-03T10:40:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"then, great security wholes in libc with 293 days uptime :)"
2011-07-22T21:33:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,worth watching it?
2011-07-22T21:34:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,watching what?
2011-07-22T21:36:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,lightdpark
2011-07-22T21:36:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,lightspark
2011-07-22T21:38:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"sure, ive seen some guys say its not bad"
2011-07-31T23:46:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,difference to a server with a GUI is used resources and lower security ;)
2011-07-31T23:52:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,exactly
2011-08-05T21:20:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,won't you need to escape the space?
2011-08-05T21:20:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"ahh you missed the first slash of media, thats all"
2011-08-05T21:20:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,:)
2011-08-05T21:21:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,yes you are right
2011-08-26T20:32:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,ah ok
2011-08-31T02:02:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,please dont suggest here to break licences
2011-08-31T02:03:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"the license is to be acceptd as part of the installation, is this what you mean>?"
2011-08-31T02:03:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,oracle doesnt allow to distribute java anymore. you only can get it from there website
2011-08-31T02:04:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"ahh I see, wasn't aware. Is that new?"
2011-08-31T02:04:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,last week
2011-08-31T02:04:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,that'd be why then :D
2011-08-31T02:04:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,oracle changed the licence last week. debian will move to openjdk and i hope ubuntu will do it also
2011-08-31T02:04:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,thanks for the news flash
2011-08-31T02:06:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,http://sylvestre.ledru.info/blog/sylvestre/2011/08/26/sun_java6_packages_removed_from_debian_u
2011-09-09T16:24:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,but a lot in performance :)
2011-09-09T16:24:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"i dunno, xubuntu is losing its light edge if you ask me"
2011-09-09T16:25:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,xubuntu is a good choise if you like gnome2 but perfomance on xubuntu isnt better then on ubuntu-desktop
2011-09-09T16:25:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,so there is only one supported DE in ubuntu left which doesnt come with very strange features
2011-09-09T16:26:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,lubuntu is official from oneiric onwards afaik
2011-09-09T16:26:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,yes
2011-09-09T16:26:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,and that is very good and i like lxde very much
2011-09-09T16:27:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"i hope they never do something like gnome2 - gnome3, kde3 - kde4, gnome - unity"
2011-09-09T16:29:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"'mate' exists, it's unofficial though"
2011-09-09T16:29:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,based on?
2011-09-09T16:30:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,or something different?
2011-09-09T16:30:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"gnome2, check omgubuntu"
2011-09-09T16:30:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,but no support anymore from the gnome-team
2011-09-09T16:30:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,true
2011-09-09T16:31:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/08/gnome-2-forked
2011-09-09T16:31:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,one very big advantages of debian is that they are very slow so the next release will also contain gnome2
2011-10-05T15:58:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,its not openoffice.org
2011-10-05T15:58:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,inside the packqage
2011-10-05T15:59:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,then its named badly and should be sorted
2011-10-05T16:01:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"its a metapackage, conflictng with openoffice and installing libreoffice"
2011-10-06T03:49:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,Zanzacar why not using the correct packagenames? :)
2011-10-06T03:49:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,probably better
2011-10-17T16:59:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,ios
2011-10-17T16:59:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,exactly ;)
2011-10-17T16:59:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,:)
2011-10-18T12:27:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,I thought the license changed..
2011-10-18T12:28:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,yes but the package is acting like flashplugin-installer (imo)
2011-10-25T17:46:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,^
2011-10-25T17:47:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,doesnt sound like a supported one
2011-10-25T17:47:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,different kernel and so on
2011-10-25T17:47:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,pretty much
2011-10-26T12:52:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,could export DISPLAY as :0 ;)
2011-10-26T12:52:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,have fun with that :)
2011-10-27T23:12:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,green
2011-10-27T23:13:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,AndChat highlights in green. Nice choice
2011-11-02T02:39:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"default is lightdm but you can use gdm if you wish, or slim or kdm"
2011-11-02T02:39:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,but gdm is not the default anymore for unity/gnome3?
2011-11-02T02:40:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,lightdm is default but others are available
2011-11-02T02:40:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"ok, thx"
2011-11-02T02:57:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,as i said earlier
2011-11-02T03:57:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,there are the archive-repos
2011-11-02T03:58:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,which hold the packages from eol releases
2011-11-02T04:00:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,i see
2011-11-04T11:13:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,5 seconds? you mean 5ms :)
2011-11-04T11:17:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,Islam lm is the important flag which says the cpu is amd64
2011-11-12T16:03:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,metapackage
2011-11-17T10:17:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,isnt network-manager ignoring that file?
2011-11-17T10:17:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,network manager will be overridden if the interfaces file is used
2011-11-17T10:17:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,ah ok
2011-11-18T05:17:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"too right, yowser"
2011-11-19T00:19:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,specially in that case there is no difference in windows and ubuntu you can do the same thing.
2011-11-19T00:20:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,just the fact of 'updates shouldnt cause issues' :-D
2011-12-14T16:16:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,why 1.8?
2011-12-14T16:17:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,i have to look at it at some tech-pages
2011-12-14T16:17:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,cant remeber the reason exactly
2011-12-14T16:17:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,i'll sniff around
2011-12-14T18:15:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,its not terminal-base its coming directly from bash
2011-12-14T18:15:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"i see, learning every day"
2011-12-14T18:15:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,me too .)
2011-12-14T18:16:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"best way, i'd hate to know everything"
2011-12-14T18:16:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,there are so many things you cant know
2011-12-14T18:17:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,e.g. key-kombinations in emacs... :)
2011-12-14T18:18:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"nano here for me, simple and easy"
2011-12-14T18:19:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,you are really a nano-user?
2011-12-14T18:24:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"yeah, and tee ;)"
2011-12-19T15:37:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,if youo set a false shell (false instead of bash) will that stop sftp access
2011-12-19T15:37:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,yes
2011-12-19T15:37:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,bums
2011-12-19T15:37:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,sftp needs a valid login-shell too
2011-12-19T15:38:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,imo there was a special login-shell to have sftp and not ssh
2011-12-19T15:38:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,but that is not the default
2012-01-04T10:24:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,i dont think its a good idea to ust copy /etc and so on to another system which maybe has different update-versions and different package-selections
2012-01-04T10:24:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,I guess
2012-01-04T10:24:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,but if the binaries are copied too it could work
2012-01-04T10:25:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,then a complete dd should be better imo (or a complete backup)
2012-01-04T10:25:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,yeah i'd go that way too
2012-01-04T10:29:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,even lxde :) great
2012-01-04T10:30:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"indeedy, although if you use terminal a lot I'd advise guake, tilda or yakuake"
2012-01-04T10:31:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,normally i have terminator in autostart but quake is nice too
2012-01-04T12:49:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,it is
2012-01-12T16:10:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,how is precise going for you?
2012-01-12T16:10:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,best release since 8.04
2012-01-12T16:11:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"snap :), although karmic was badass here"
2012-01-12T16:13:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,it will be very hard to go from 12.04 to 12.10 because its running so great here :)
2012-01-12T16:13:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,hehe I always in stall the pre-alpha just to see if my hardware will still always work out of the box
2012-01-12T16:21:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"i love 'bug-hunting' to much, so i always need a unstable-release :)"
2012-01-25T22:37:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,except for editors of course :)
2012-01-25T22:37:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,ahhahha
2012-01-26T01:53:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"just for the record, the new unity with HUD looks awesome (and you know i am a big lxde fan)"
2012-01-26T01:54:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,i like the lxde look. Unity is really OTT for me
2012-01-26T01:54:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,you saw HUD?
2012-01-26T01:55:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,its a killerfeature (imo)
2012-01-26T01:56:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"i use about 5 apps, most which I use in CLI :)"
2012-01-26T01:57:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,ok but i think for normal users unity is on a good way
2012-01-26T01:58:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"I guess. I don't think its up to much, a lot of work for the same output i can get in a fraction of the time"
2012-01-26T01:59:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"yes you are right, normally you need only 5 programs, x, terminator, gnome-terminal, zsh and vim :)"
2012-01-29T22:09:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,are yu facing this? https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lxpanel/+bug/906825
2012-01-29T22:11:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,facing what?
2012-01-29T22:11:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,the bug i posted
2012-01-29T22:12:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"not had that, only thing I get is gmail-notify makling the panel a mess. I have a script to kill th notifier and panl, thenrestart it then restart the notifier app"
2012-01-29T22:13:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,ah the 'spaces' bug :)
2012-01-29T22:13:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"yeah and half icons, stuff like that"
2012-01-29T22:13:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,I'm half thinking of jumping to tint2
2012-01-30T00:36:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,480MBit/s / 8 = 60MByte/s
2012-01-30T00:38:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,yes :)
2012-01-30T00:38:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,but hard to find on my netbook :)
2012-02-03T21:42:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"its not the server, the lines in sources.list are wrong"
2012-02-03T21:42:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,ahhhh
2012-02-03T21:42:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,he is using deb http.//foobar ubuntu-main ubuntu-universe instead of main universe and so on
2012-02-04T22:40:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"i am facing the icons-bug in lxde too with the missing transparents, do you have already a bug?"
2012-02-04T22:41:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"yeah reported it dude, want the link?"
2012-02-04T22:41:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,would be great

2012-02-08T05:24:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,no flash for ppc or arm?
2012-02-08T05:24:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,not as far as I knw
2012-02-21T01:50:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,you can use windows executables in WIne
2012-02-21T01:50:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,users which are using firefox with wine so that there is a notepad entry should go directly to ##windows
2012-02-21T01:51:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"firefox will be a native app, the config of file associtaion will be an ubuntu misconfiguration..."
2012-02-21T01:51:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,but i dont see where 'notepad' should came from
2012-02-21T01:52:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"if you install wine, you get notepad as part of the install"
2012-02-21T01:52:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"hm never noticed that, thanks"
2012-03-15T22:19:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,newer features to be taken advantage of etc
2012-04-06T01:09:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,you are very slow :)
2012-04-06T01:09:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,yeahm I stopped to order a pizza
2012-04-06T01:10:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,there is a nice irssi-script to order pizza :)
2012-04-06T01:10:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,sweet
2012-05-01T22:25:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,he is using wubi
2012-05-01T22:25:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,gah
2012-05-20T14:18:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,11.10 I believe.
2012-05-20T14:18:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,ok
2012-08-01T01:56:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"gcc is also in the repos, to we support c/c++ here? :)"
2012-08-01T01:56:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,i'd imagine so ;)
2012-08-01T01:56:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,ok :) then i will redirect every c/c++ in the future to you ;)
2012-08-01T01:57:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"its supported here, there are just other channels which are more accurate :)"
2012-08-16T04:23:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,did you use gksudo recently?
2012-08-16T04:23:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,no
2012-08-16T04:23:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"login maybe 15 minutes before, no sudo action then"
2012-08-16T04:24:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,maybe its a post login thing. Which release?
2012-08-16T04:24:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"12.04 (unity), lubuntu is not acting like that"
2012-08-16T04:25:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,weird indeed. Is it part of polkit etc?
2012-08-16T04:25:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,will look into that
2012-08-16T04:26:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,in my opinion a big security issue when the system can install software without extra sudo
2012-08-16T04:26:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,I suggest you report a bug
2012-08-16T04:27:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,guess you are right
2012-10-11T15:07:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,AD
2012-10-11T15:08:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,can samba not do that?
2012-10-11T15:08:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,no
2012-10-11T15:08:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"samba3 = nt domain, samba 4 = AD"
2012-10-11T15:08:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"thanks, learned something today :)"
2012-10-11T15:08:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,as a primary domain controller
2012-10-11T15:09:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"nt uses AD, just an older version :)"
2012-10-11T15:09:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,:)
2012-10-11T15:12:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,if i am correct hplib/cups are also using some samba4 stuff now
2012-10-11T15:13:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,i have samba4 packages on my system because of my network printer on 12.04
2012-10-31T18:22:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,no
2012-10-31T18:23:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"sure, maximum RAM for each process is 3.2Gb and the system has barely over that so it will never be reached"
2012-10-31T18:23:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,plus the PAE will allow up to 64Gb RAM
2009-04-16T16:11:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,thats not using 3d glasses
2009-04-16T16:12:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,i have not seen his second line
2009-04-17T15:19:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,crank all the sliders up
2009-04-17T15:19:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,or buy a preamp ;)
2009-04-17T15:19:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,all up and i dont want to use a preamp on my eeepc
2009-04-17T15:20:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,i'm pretty sure the speaker in an eepc will be fairly poor
2009-04-17T15:21:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,on windows its much loader then on ubuntu
2009-04-17T15:21:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,so i think its a software-problem
2009-04-17T15:22:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,try a different driver or different driver settings
2009-06-24T14:11:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"same deal, yours is quicker"
2009-06-24T14:11:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,i think so :)
2009-06-24T14:12:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,i bet theres even a klingon pack (some sad loser will have made it)
2009-06-24T14:13:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"yes, i have seen it"
2009-06-24T14:16:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,more often is ubunto
2009-06-24T14:17:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,:) also they asked for wlan-cable?
2009-06-26T16:28:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,normal ubuntu also using PAE in he kernel?
2009-06-26T16:28:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"afaik, no"
2009-07-09T12:18:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,s/pure/--purge
2009-07-09T12:18:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"yeah, thx"
2009-07-23T13:42:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,simple isn't it .. ;)
2009-07-23T13:42:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,i thought it is... :)
2009-07-23T13:45:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,you are to fast for me :)
2009-07-23T13:45:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,i use cli mostly dude ;)
2009-07-23T13:46:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"same here but it is early in the morning, so i am sleeping a little bit, that is your advantage"
2009-07-26T00:09:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,there is on action you need a real root (with eraly ubuntu-version)
2009-07-26T00:09:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"if you boot and fsck will repair the drive, it ask for the root-password"
2009-07-26T00:13:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,the bootup process is all as root so shuld not ask for a passowrd
2009-07-26T00:14:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"an early ubuntu-version was asking this, dont know  the version anymore"
2009-07-26T00:14:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,lsb_release -c will tell you
2009-07-26T00:15:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"no, i mean that years ago i was using a version which was asking for the root-password .)"
2009-07-26T00:16:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,weird
2009-09-05T23:33:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,the apps will be compiled for 64bit systems so will be fully 64bit
2009-09-05T23:33:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,thank you
2009-09-11T01:48:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"xlsx is not proprietary, its zipped xml"
2009-09-11T01:49:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,nice
2009-09-11T01:49:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"like docx, its also zipped xml, he old format doc,xls and so on are proprietary"
2009-09-11T01:50:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,every day is a school day
2009-09-11T01:51:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,that is the interessing part of computers
2009-09-11T01:51:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,definately :D
2009-09-30T16:59:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"make compiles the source with the config from configure, make install is the only step needing root (assuming you are compiling in your own home folder) as you will be writing to where you dont have write access"
2009-09-30T17:00:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"so i only need root because it wants to access /etc/ and so on. if i say, use /home for the installation, i dont need root?"
2009-09-30T17:01:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"correct, the make you can do as yourself provided you have write access where you are compiling"
2009-09-30T17:02:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"thank you alot, then i will do some 'make' instead of 'apt-get' to learn more about it. (its just a test-vm)"
2009-09-30T17:03:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,if the package is on the repo you can apt-get it
2009-09-30T17:03:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,ifconfig
2009-09-30T17:03:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"it is i just want to learn to build something from source, its just for testing in a vm"
2009-09-30T17:04:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,no harm in that at all :D
2009-09-30T17:05:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,i was also successfull with building my first *.deb  it was a litte pythonscript and now i can install it with dpkg -i myfile.deb :)
2009-09-30T17:05:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"nice, wtg :)"
2009-10-14T16:54:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"i find it smoother, not really faster"
2009-10-14T16:55:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,http://download.macromedia.com/pub/labs/flashplayer10/libflashplayer-10.0.32.18.linux-x86_64.so.tar.gz
2009-10-14T16:56:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,thx
2009-10-14T16:56:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,can you /msg me that link? i am at work and cant save that link
2009-10-14T16:56:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,uninstall the flashplugin package and put thet in your plugins dir (or you can put it in ~/.mozilla/plugins
2009-10-15T14:58:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,flash is working better (but not perfect) on amd64 :)
2009-11-05T17:18:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,you can display the dhcp clients in the server usually
2009-11-05T17:19:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"that client will not get an ip, because the mac is nowhere, so the real reason i want to see the dhcp-asking task is to get the mac-adress of that client"
2009-11-05T17:20:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,use arp then
2009-11-05T17:20:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,the client is a NAS
2009-11-05T17:21:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,still has an IP and MAC so should respond to ARP
2009-11-05T17:21:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,unless its configured not to respond to it
2009-11-05T17:22:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"it has no ip, this network dhcp only gives ips to known mac adresses"
2009-11-05T17:22:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,so i need that mac-adress
2009-11-05T17:22:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,and with the dhcp-asking there should be the mac-adress
2009-11-05T17:22:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,i tink you will have to attend the NAS physically then
2009-11-05T17:22:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,otherwise i am unsure
2009-11-05T17:24:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,its not a good idea because i am on a thin client and cant use a peer-to-peer-connection with the NAS because i will loosing contact to terminal-server
2009-11-11T16:17:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,gotcha
2009-11-12T17:05:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,ifconfig
2009-11-12T17:06:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,and what is the parameter? have not found anything
2009-11-12T17:07:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,usually says in that output the speed its running
2009-11-12T17:07:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,not here
2009-11-26T15:49:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,its getting ubuntu booted though
2009-11-26T15:50:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,?
2009-11-26T15:50:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,i thouht you were gonna kick him over to ##windows ;)
2009-11-26T15:50:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"yes, thats normally my job here :)"
2009-11-26T15:51:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,can we start a 'wubi needs to burn and should be scrapped' petition
2009-11-26T15:51:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"never used wubi, so i dont know if it is a bad thing"
2009-11-26T15:56:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,mounted partition remember ;)
2009-11-26T15:57:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,live-cd is automounting (if i am correct)
2009-11-26T15:57:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,sure but under /media   /boot is in the live CD environment
2009-11-26T16:00:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,":( yes, you are right"
2009-11-26T16:01:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,got your back bro
2009-12-01T01:38:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,but not the one from vlc :)  good evenning dude
2009-12-01T01:40:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,howdy
2009-12-01T01:40:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,mplayer is one of the oldest and respected players around
2009-12-01T01:43:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,but if i am correct mplayer dont have own codecs like vlc
2009-12-01T01:43:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"sure it doesm, it installs what it needs to run"
2009-12-01T01:44:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,codecs are universal too so all players can use the codecs if they are installed :)
2009-12-01T01:45:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,thats correct but vlc comes with some nice codecs (other apps not using)
2009-12-01T01:46:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,not had an issue personally
2009-12-01T01:47:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,try some nonfree things without a distribution which has ubuntu-restrcited-extras
2009-12-28T16:01:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,a browser ;)
2009-12-28T16:01:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,a garbage browser too ;)
2009-12-28T16:02:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,you can name a better oss browser?
2009-12-28T16:02:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,chromium   easily
2009-12-28T16:02:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,its a chrome-forke isnt it?
2009-12-28T16:02:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,its a bleeding edge chrome
2009-12-28T16:02:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,with addblock?
2009-12-28T16:03:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"i installed it today, yes"
2009-12-28T16:03:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,maybe i will have a look. i will trust your mind :)
2009-12-29T19:24:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,they will have backups AFTER the first crash
2009-12-29T19:25:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"true, same they have to lear the hardest way"
2009-12-29T19:25:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,sure
2009-12-29T19:29:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,they dont
2009-12-29T19:29:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"didnt think so, apple are morons"
2010-01-03T03:35:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,i am to slow for you :(
2010-02-15T23:40:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,may have to add a command to uninstall adobe-flashplugin
2010-02-15T23:40:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,why uninstall?
2010-02-15T23:41:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,ah yes
2010-03-06T13:05:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,crossover is imo a patched version
2010-03-06T13:05:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,but never looked at crossover
2010-03-06T13:06:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,just reading some articles and bug-reports
2010-03-06T13:08:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"of course, because it is wine but the focus is imo on ms office"
2010-03-17T14:22:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,only shebang (perl)
2010-03-17T14:22:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,cheers dude
2010-04-24T08:20:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,put !slow on your clipboard ;)
2010-04-24T08:24:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"yes, that is another reason"
2010-06-08T23:27:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"if you dont like firefox, try iceweasel :)"
2010-06-26T22:23:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"ok, never looked at it"
2010-06-26T22:24:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,dk: http://www.ubuntugeek.com/enable-ctrl-alt-backspace-in-ubuntukubuntu-10-04lucid-lynx.html
2010-07-10T11:13:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"i'd say a lot of others are equally easy, ubuntu just seems to make the most noise"
2010-07-10T11:14:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"the others dont have nice tools  for installing restricted things, mostly the dont have a metapackage, also they are using old software (lenny)"
2010-07-10T11:15:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"depends no the distro, gentoo has some awesomeness and emerge is great"
2010-07-10T11:15:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,i dont think a 'newbie' want a rolling release distri basd on source-code
2010-07-10T11:16:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"its just a different way to manage a distro, suse and mandriva are also as easy imho"
2010-07-10T11:17:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,apt-get > yast
2010-07-10T11:17:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,al works equally fine here
2010-07-10T11:21:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"you have distris which dont want to use nonfree firmware, nonfree drivers and so on (debian) so its hard for beginners to get hardware working, ubuntu doesnt care much about that 'everything has to be free'"
2010-08-05T00:27:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,i am just posting a text from debian without my personal opinion
2010-08-05T00:28:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,gotcha
2011-03-03T20:15:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,dude its 1200 lines
2011-03-03T20:16:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,could get a pm instead....
2011-03-03T20:17:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,Pici of course i mean he should post the pastebin link to mainchat not the content
2011-03-12T03:23:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,i dont think he will make a backup first and in 10 minutes he tells he lost all his data
2011-03-12T03:24:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,most don't. I have my sign ready :)
2011-03-12T03:27:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,people like to learn the hard way :(
2011-03-28T19:29:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,its fixed now
2011-03-28T19:31:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,but webmin is not a good way to edit configs and he asked about a good gui program
2011-03-28T19:31:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"a good gui-application for working with configs is gvim, emacs or gedit"
2011-03-28T19:43:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"webmin is a gui, just accesses via a web browser..."
2011-03-28T19:44:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,and writing config-files
2011-03-28T19:44:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"like yast, plesk and other tools from the hell do"
2011-05-05T00:14:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,add -C too (enables compression)
2011-06-03T10:38:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,ksplice
2011-06-03T10:40:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"then, great security wholes in libc with 293 days uptime :)"
2011-07-22T21:33:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,worth watching it?
2011-07-22T21:34:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,watching what?
2011-07-22T21:36:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,lightdpark
2011-07-22T21:36:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,lightspark
2011-07-22T21:38:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"sure, ive seen some guys say its not bad"
2011-07-31T23:46:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,difference to a server with a GUI is used resources and lower security ;)
2011-07-31T23:52:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,exactly
2011-08-05T21:20:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,won't you need to escape the space?
2011-08-05T21:20:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"ahh you missed the first slash of media, thats all"
2011-08-05T21:20:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,:)
2011-08-05T21:21:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,yes you are right
2011-08-26T20:32:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,ah ok
2011-08-31T02:02:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,please dont suggest here to break licences
2011-08-31T02:03:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"the license is to be acceptd as part of the installation, is this what you mean>?"
2011-08-31T02:03:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,oracle doesnt allow to distribute java anymore. you only can get it from there website
2011-08-31T02:04:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"ahh I see, wasn't aware. Is that new?"
2011-08-31T02:04:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,last week
2011-08-31T02:04:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,that'd be why then :D
2011-08-31T02:04:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,oracle changed the licence last week. debian will move to openjdk and i hope ubuntu will do it also
2011-08-31T02:04:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,thanks for the news flash
2011-08-31T02:06:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,http://sylvestre.ledru.info/blog/sylvestre/2011/08/26/sun_java6_packages_removed_from_debian_u
2011-09-09T16:24:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,but a lot in performance :)
2011-09-09T16:24:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"i dunno, xubuntu is losing its light edge if you ask me"
2011-09-09T16:25:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,xubuntu is a good choise if you like gnome2 but perfomance on xubuntu isnt better then on ubuntu-desktop
2011-09-09T16:25:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,so there is only one supported DE in ubuntu left which doesnt come with very strange features
2011-09-09T16:26:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,lubuntu is official from oneiric onwards afaik
2011-09-09T16:26:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,yes
2011-09-09T16:26:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,and that is very good and i like lxde very much
2011-09-09T16:27:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"i hope they never do something like gnome2 - gnome3, kde3 - kde4, gnome - unity"
2011-09-09T16:29:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"'mate' exists, it's unofficial though"
2011-09-09T16:29:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,based on?
2011-09-09T16:30:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,or something different?
2011-09-09T16:30:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"gnome2, check omgubuntu"
2011-09-09T16:30:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,but no support anymore from the gnome-team
2011-09-09T16:30:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,true
2011-09-09T16:31:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/08/gnome-2-forked
2011-09-09T16:31:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,one very big advantages of debian is that they are very slow so the next release will also contain gnome2
2011-10-05T15:58:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,its not openoffice.org
2011-10-05T15:58:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,inside the packqage
2011-10-05T15:59:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,then its named badly and should be sorted
2011-10-05T16:01:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"its a metapackage, conflictng with openoffice and installing libreoffice"
2011-10-06T03:49:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,Zanzacar why not using the correct packagenames? :)
2011-10-06T03:49:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,probably better
2011-10-17T16:59:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,ios
2011-10-17T16:59:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,exactly ;)
2011-10-17T16:59:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,:)
2011-10-18T12:27:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,I thought the license changed..
2011-10-18T12:28:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,yes but the package is acting like flashplugin-installer (imo)
2011-10-25T17:46:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,^
2011-10-25T17:47:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,doesnt sound like a supported one
2011-10-25T17:47:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,different kernel and so on
2011-10-25T17:47:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,pretty much
2011-10-26T12:52:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,could export DISPLAY as :0 ;)
2011-10-26T12:52:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,have fun with that :)
2011-10-27T23:12:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,green
2011-10-27T23:13:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,AndChat highlights in green. Nice choice
2011-11-02T02:39:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"default is lightdm but you can use gdm if you wish, or slim or kdm"
2011-11-02T02:39:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,but gdm is not the default anymore for unity/gnome3?
2011-11-02T02:40:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,lightdm is default but others are available
2011-11-02T02:40:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"ok, thx"
2011-11-02T02:57:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,as i said earlier
2011-11-02T03:57:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,there are the archive-repos
2011-11-02T03:58:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,which hold the packages from eol releases
2011-11-02T04:00:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,i see
2011-11-04T11:13:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,5 seconds? you mean 5ms :)
2011-11-04T11:17:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,Islam lm is the important flag which says the cpu is amd64
2011-11-12T16:03:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,metapackage
2011-11-17T10:17:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,isnt network-manager ignoring that file?
2011-11-17T10:17:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,network manager will be overridden if the interfaces file is used
2011-11-17T10:17:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,ah ok
2011-11-18T05:17:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"too right, yowser"
2011-11-19T00:19:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,specially in that case there is no difference in windows and ubuntu you can do the same thing.
2011-11-19T00:20:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,just the fact of 'updates shouldnt cause issues' :-D
2011-12-14T16:16:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,why 1.8?
2011-12-14T16:17:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,i have to look at it at some tech-pages
2011-12-14T16:17:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,cant remeber the reason exactly
2011-12-14T16:17:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,i'll sniff around
2011-12-14T18:15:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,its not terminal-base its coming directly from bash
2011-12-14T18:15:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"i see, learning every day"
2011-12-14T18:15:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,me too .)
2011-12-14T18:16:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"best way, i'd hate to know everything"
2011-12-14T18:16:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,there are so many things you cant know
2011-12-14T18:17:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,e.g. key-kombinations in emacs... :)
2011-12-14T18:18:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"nano here for me, simple and easy"
2011-12-14T18:19:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,you are really a nano-user?
2011-12-14T18:24:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"yeah, and tee ;)"
2011-12-19T15:37:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,if youo set a false shell (false instead of bash) will that stop sftp access
2011-12-19T15:37:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,yes
2011-12-19T15:37:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,bums
2011-12-19T15:37:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,sftp needs a valid login-shell too
2011-12-19T15:38:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,imo there was a special login-shell to have sftp and not ssh
2011-12-19T15:38:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,but that is not the default
2012-01-04T10:24:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,i dont think its a good idea to ust copy /etc and so on to another system which maybe has different update-versions and different package-selections
2012-01-04T10:24:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,I guess
2012-01-04T10:24:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,but if the binaries are copied too it could work
2012-01-04T10:25:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,then a complete dd should be better imo (or a complete backup)
2012-01-04T10:25:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,yeah i'd go that way too
2012-01-04T10:29:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,even lxde :) great
2012-01-04T10:30:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"indeedy, although if you use terminal a lot I'd advise guake, tilda or yakuake"
2012-01-04T10:31:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,normally i have terminator in autostart but quake is nice too
2012-01-04T12:49:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,it is
2012-01-12T16:10:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,how is precise going for you?
2012-01-12T16:10:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,best release since 8.04
2012-01-12T16:11:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"snap :), although karmic was badass here"
2012-01-12T16:13:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,it will be very hard to go from 12.04 to 12.10 because its running so great here :)
2012-01-12T16:13:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,hehe I always in stall the pre-alpha just to see if my hardware will still always work out of the box
2012-01-12T16:21:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"i love 'bug-hunting' to much, so i always need a unstable-release :)"
2012-01-25T22:37:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,except for editors of course :)
2012-01-25T22:37:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,ahhahha
2012-01-26T01:53:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"just for the record, the new unity with HUD looks awesome (and you know i am a big lxde fan)"
2012-01-26T01:54:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,i like the lxde look. Unity is really OTT for me
2012-01-26T01:54:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,you saw HUD?
2012-01-26T01:55:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,its a killerfeature (imo)
2012-01-26T01:56:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"i use about 5 apps, most which I use in CLI :)"
2012-01-26T01:57:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,ok but i think for normal users unity is on a good way
2012-01-26T01:58:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"I guess. I don't think its up to much, a lot of work for the same output i can get in a fraction of the time"
2012-01-26T01:59:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"yes you are right, normally you need only 5 programs, x, terminator, gnome-terminal, zsh and vim :)"
2012-01-29T22:09:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,are yu facing this? https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lxpanel/+bug/906825
2012-01-29T22:11:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,facing what?
2012-01-29T22:11:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,the bug i posted
2012-01-29T22:12:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"not had that, only thing I get is gmail-notify makling the panel a mess. I have a script to kill th notifier and panl, thenrestart it then restart the notifier app"
2012-01-29T22:13:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,ah the 'spaces' bug :)
2012-01-29T22:13:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"yeah and half icons, stuff like that"
2012-01-29T22:13:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,I'm half thinking of jumping to tint2
2012-01-30T00:36:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,480MBit/s / 8 = 60MByte/s
2012-01-30T00:38:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,yes :)
2012-01-30T00:38:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,but hard to find on my netbook :)
2012-02-03T21:42:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"its not the server, the lines in sources.list are wrong"
2012-02-03T21:42:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,ahhhh
2012-02-03T21:42:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,he is using deb http.//foobar ubuntu-main ubuntu-universe instead of main universe and so on
2012-02-04T22:40:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"i am facing the icons-bug in lxde too with the missing transparents, do you have already a bug?"
2012-02-04T22:41:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"yeah reported it dude, want the link?"
2012-02-04T22:41:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,would be great

2012-02-08T05:24:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,no flash for ppc or arm?
2012-02-08T05:24:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,not as far as I knw
2012-02-21T01:50:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,you can use windows executables in WIne
2012-02-21T01:50:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,users which are using firefox with wine so that there is a notepad entry should go directly to ##windows
2012-02-21T01:51:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"firefox will be a native app, the config of file associtaion will be an ubuntu misconfiguration..."
2012-02-21T01:51:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,but i dont see where 'notepad' should came from
2012-02-21T01:52:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"if you install wine, you get notepad as part of the install"
2012-02-21T01:52:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"hm never noticed that, thanks"
2012-03-15T22:19:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,newer features to be taken advantage of etc
2012-04-06T01:09:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,you are very slow :)
2012-04-06T01:09:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,yeahm I stopped to order a pizza
2012-04-06T01:10:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,there is a nice irssi-script to order pizza :)
2012-04-06T01:10:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,sweet
2012-05-01T22:25:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,he is using wubi
2012-05-01T22:25:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,gah
2012-05-20T14:18:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,11.10 I believe.
2012-05-20T14:18:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,ok
2012-08-01T01:56:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"gcc is also in the repos, to we support c/c++ here? :)"
2012-08-01T01:56:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,i'd imagine so ;)
2012-08-01T01:56:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,ok :) then i will redirect every c/c++ in the future to you ;)
2012-08-01T01:57:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"its supported here, there are just other channels which are more accurate :)"
2012-08-16T04:23:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,did you use gksudo recently?
2012-08-16T04:23:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,no
2012-08-16T04:23:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"login maybe 15 minutes before, no sudo action then"
2012-08-16T04:24:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,maybe its a post login thing. Which release?
2012-08-16T04:24:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"12.04 (unity), lubuntu is not acting like that"
2012-08-16T04:25:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,weird indeed. Is it part of polkit etc?
2012-08-16T04:25:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,will look into that
2012-08-16T04:26:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,in my opinion a big security issue when the system can install software without extra sudo
2012-08-16T04:26:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,I suggest you report a bug
2012-08-16T04:27:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,guess you are right
2012-10-11T15:07:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,AD
2012-10-11T15:08:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,can samba not do that?
2012-10-11T15:08:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,no
2012-10-11T15:08:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,"samba3 = nt domain, samba 4 = AD"
2012-10-11T15:08:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"thanks, learned something today :)"
2012-10-11T15:08:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,as a primary domain controller
2012-10-11T15:09:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"nt uses AD, just an older version :)"
2012-10-11T15:09:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,:)
2012-10-11T15:12:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,if i am correct hplib/cups are also using some samba4 stuff now
2012-10-11T15:13:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,i have samba4 packages on my system because of my network printer on 12.04
2012-10-31T18:22:00.000Z,iceroot,ActionParsnip,no
2012-10-31T18:23:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,"sure, maximum RAM for each process is 3.2Gb and the system has barely over that so it will never be reached"
2012-10-31T18:23:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,iceroot,plus the PAE will allow up to 64Gb RAM
