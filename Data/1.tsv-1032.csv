2005-01-01T16:35:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,thanks for asking :)
2005-01-01T16:36:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"np, I remember my own marathon training. :)"
2005-01-01T16:36:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,yeah?
2005-01-01T16:37:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,how come you don't hang out in #fitgeek?
2005-01-01T16:37:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,didn't know of it til just now :)
2005-01-02T17:41:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,what's your lspci line for the sound chipset?
2005-01-02T17:41:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,sec
2005-01-02T17:42:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,lsmod|grep snd_intel8x0
2005-01-02T17:42:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,it found some stuff :)
2005-01-02T17:43:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"a bunch of stuff, should I paste in /msg?"
2005-01-02T17:43:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,or in #flood
2005-01-02T17:43:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,either.
2005-01-02T17:43:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,alsamixer(1) should work
2005-01-02T17:44:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,see it?
2005-01-02T17:44:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"indeed, sec."
2005-01-02T17:45:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,tx sorry to bug you :)
2005-01-02T17:45:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,take your time
2005-01-02T17:45:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,what happens when you use alsamixer?
2005-01-02T17:45:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"actually, have we established that snd-intel8x0 is loaded?"
2005-01-02T17:46:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,#flood again
2005-01-02T17:46:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,there you go.
2005-01-02T17:47:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,and now run alsamixer
2005-01-02T17:48:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,sudo echo 'snd-intel8x0m' >> /etc/hotplug/blacklist
2005-01-02T17:49:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"when you reboot, it should work"
2005-01-02T17:49:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,k... not working atm though after removing that module.  ( ogra )
2005-01-02T17:52:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,occy.net is back up btw.... check out the new changes ;)
2005-01-02T17:55:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,contents of /proc/asound/cards ?
2005-01-02T17:55:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,looking
2005-01-02T17:55:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,no soundcards
2005-01-02T17:55:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,is this a laptop?
2005-01-02T17:56:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,yessir
2005-01-02T17:56:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,dell?
2005-01-02T17:56:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,yup.  Dell inspiron 8200
2005-01-02T17:56:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"reboot, disable the modem and printer port in bios."
2005-01-02T17:56:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,on it 007
2005-01-02T06:00:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,the best thing to do is to use the acpi boot param
2005-01-02T06:00:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,the harder hack is to disable stuff in bios
2005-01-02T06:01:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,the recommended procedure is to use the acpi boot param as outlined in the url ogra pasted.
2005-01-02T06:02:00.000Z,occy,crimsun, ogra tx bunches guys.  You are both a peach. :)
2005-01-02T06:08:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"you're using Warty, correct?"
2005-01-02T06:08:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,yup
2005-01-02T06:09:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"for a permanent solution, sudo $EDITOR /boot/grub/menu.list"
2005-01-02T06:09:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,scroll to the line marked with # kopt=....
2005-01-02T06:09:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,and add the acpi_... to the end
2005-01-02T06:09:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,then run `sudo update-grub'
2005-01-02T06:13:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,it should be at the end of the commented kopt line
2005-01-02T06:14:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,yep. Make sure there's a hash mark at the beginning.
2005-01-02T06:20:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"so whenever you like, drop by #fitgeek ;)"
2005-01-02T06:21:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"oh, have you heard my band yet?  ( ogra too )"
2005-01-02T07:54:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,you have a personal website?
2005-01-02T09:00:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,tx again for your help yesterday evening.
2005-01-02T09:00:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,occy.net (left sidebar)
2005-01-02T09:00:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"np :) No, I don't maintain a web page. Yes, I'm the same one on debianplanet.org et al."
2005-01-02T09:00:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,haha
2005-01-02T09:00:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,you read my mind..
2005-01-02T09:03:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,possibly. Does the jvm tell you which applet fails to init?
2005-01-02T09:03:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"hmmm, is there a console I can initiate or something to ascertain that?"
2005-01-02T09:04:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,sometimes the error is printed in the space on the web page where the applet should have loaded; sometimes it creates a log file in ~
2005-01-02T09:04:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"yep, that works, too."
2005-01-02T09:07:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,does that look bad?
2005-01-02T09:07:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,which jre/jdk are you using?
2005-01-02T09:08:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,hmm. 1.4.x?
2005-01-02T09:08:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,yah... sec
2005-01-02T09:09:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"for the moz-firefox plugin, just the symlink is sufficient"
2005-01-02T09:10:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"right, but if it needs some sort of local system java stuff, won't it need the path to be set?"
2005-01-02T09:10:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"actually in that case, $CLASSPATH would need to be set"
2005-01-02T09:10:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,how can I do that. (man you are a busy guy)
2005-01-02T09:11:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"prepending the $JAVA_HOME/bin path to your $PATH may help, too"
2005-01-02T09:13:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,export PATH=/usr/local/bin/j2re1.4.2/bin:$PATH
2005-01-02T09:18:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,usually I edit /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 and do what Pozac said.
2005-01-02T09:18:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,then `sudo invoke-rc.d gdm restart'
2005-01-02T09:28:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,got the gdm straightened out?
2005-01-02T09:40:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,:/
2005-01-02T09:40:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,can't seem to keep 1024x768 in 24bpp but 1400x1050 does
2005-01-02T09:41:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"in Section 'Screen' of /etc/X11/XF86Config-4, did you modify the Modes line in Depth 24?"
2005-01-02T09:41:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,and you have a 'DefaultDepth 24'?
2005-01-02T09:42:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,what's the Modes line?
2005-01-02T09:44:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,can you alter that to: Modes '1024x768' '1400x1050'
2005-01-03T08:10:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"have you tried jre 1.5.0, for instance?"
2005-01-03T08:11:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,hmmm I am on 1.5.0
2005-01-03T08:13:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,any ideas on a url for 1.5.0?   The java.sun.com site is a nightmare
2005-01-03T08:14:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,sec.
2005-01-03T08:14:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,k bud
2005-01-03T08:14:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp and choose JRE 5.0 Update 1
2005-01-03T08:16:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,got it :)
2005-01-03T08:16:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,did you check out my bands site?
2005-01-03T08:17:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"haven't had time, sorry. I've been working on syllabi."
2005-01-03T08:17:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"ahh, no worries mate."
2005-01-03T08:22:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"gotta do a bit of manual rearranging with the symlink and $PATH, too"
2005-01-03T08:24:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,yeah?
2005-01-03T08:27:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"oh, right.  Sorry, I catch you now."
2005-01-03T07:17:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,around?
2005-01-03T10:12:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"hmm, I don't believe you're supposed to run java_vm directly, but it's good practice to set $JAVA_HOME, to add $JAVA_HOME/bin to your $PATH, and to set $CLASSPATH as well"
2005-01-05T10:11:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,what precisely is broken with it?
2005-01-05T10:11:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,heyaz bud.
2005-01-05T10:11:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"can't launch the java app.  The sad thing is, it's with a company that I can't let anyone have access to it."
2005-01-05T10:12:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"heya. Sorry, my responses will be erratic 'cos I'm at work."
2005-01-05T10:12:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,java can run on other websites just fine.  Yahoo games for example.
2005-01-05T10:12:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,no worries ;)
2005-01-05T12:44:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,depends on what you need to develop
2005-01-05T12:44:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,need to compile latest qemu :)
2005-01-05T12:45:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,I presume you have the 'universe' repo enabled?
2005-01-05T12:45:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"yessir, universe and multiverse"
2005-01-05T12:45:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,`sudo apt-get build-dep qemu'
2005-01-05T12:46:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,that'll build from cvs?
2005-01-05T12:46:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"no, that installs all the necessary packages for you to compile 'qemu'"
2005-01-05T12:46:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,it's up to you to retrieve qemu's source
2005-01-05T12:46:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,sweet
2005-01-05T12:47:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,that is very nice
2005-01-09T07:06:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,better purge the FC1 ;)
2005-01-09T07:06:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,hehe
2005-01-09T07:07:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"trust me, I want to.  I can't seem to get past that one install issue where it hangs when trying to start the installl."
2005-01-09T08:01:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,you here still ?
2005-01-09T08:05:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"yep, still here (sorry, editing a wiki page)"
2005-01-09T08:05:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,np bud.
2005-01-09T08:06:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,really want to get Ubuntu on it. :(
2005-01-09T08:41:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,thankfully it's transparent under Ubuntu
2005-01-09T08:41:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"yah, very nice under Ubuntu."
2005-01-09T08:41:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,burning Hoary atm.
2005-01-09T08:41:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,g'luck
2005-01-09T08:42:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,heh
2005-01-09T08:42:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"I'm out for 1.5 hours, but I'll be back. Feel free to ping me then if you're still awake."
2005-01-09T08:42:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,later bud. ;)
2005-01-13T08:43:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,heyaz bud.  It was pretty good.  We played a private party.
2005-01-13T08:43:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,our band that is.
2005-01-13T08:44:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,cool :)
2005-01-13T08:44:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"nomasteryoda <-- lives near me and has the same laptop.  Going to either swap hard drives for an install, or use his cd."
2005-01-13T08:45:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,excellent :)
2005-01-13T08:46:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,does apt-get update and apt-get dist-upgrade keep your kernel up-to-date.... or do you have to manually do that?
2005-01-13T08:46:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,update & upgrade will do fine
2005-01-13T08:46:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"you're running warty, correct?"
2005-01-13T08:47:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,ahh ok.
2005-01-13T08:47:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,yah... I should probably stick with it instead of hoary.
2005-01-13T08:47:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,or do you feel it might be stable enough?
2005-01-13T08:48:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,not quite stable enough yet
2005-01-13T08:48:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"it tends to be even more bleeding-edge than sid+experimental, which is impressive"
2005-01-13T08:48:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,the cool thing would be... You could have people do voting to say how they feel things are working for them at present.
2005-01-13T08:48:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,hehe
2005-01-13T08:48:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,did that make sense?
2005-01-13T08:49:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,sure.
2005-01-13T08:52:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,ubuntu has me feeling like I'm back in the Linux community again. :)
2005-01-13T08:53:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,are you familiar with apt-listbugs(1) ?
2005-01-13T08:53:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I reckon not buddy.
2005-01-13T08:54:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,it does something in the vein of what you seek for upgrades
2005-01-13T08:54:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,ahhh
2005-01-13T08:54:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"highly, highly recommended in addition to apt-listchanges(8)"
2005-01-13T08:54:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,what does the (1) signify?
2005-01-13T08:55:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,I just use it to denote what type of program it is; sometimes I use it to denote a man page.
2005-01-13T08:55:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"ahhh, nice."
2005-01-13T08:55:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,figured that was what you were hinting at ;)
2005-01-29T12:29:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"if you're absolutely teeting for it, uupdate & family."
2005-01-29T12:29:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,heyaz bud.
2005-01-29T12:29:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"otherwise, wait an afternoon or two and it'll be pulled in."
2005-01-29T12:30:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,family?
2005-01-29T12:30:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"heya, how's life?"
2005-01-29T12:30:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,never heard that term before
2005-01-29T12:31:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"'uupdate' is part of the 'devscripts' package, which you can use to generate the infrastructure for creating a deb from a new upstream source revision."
2005-01-29T12:37:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,are you running Hoary?
2005-01-29T12:37:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,no sir
2005-01-29T12:38:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,hoary horked on me the other day.
2005-01-29T12:38:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,safe to upgrade at the moment?
2005-01-29T12:38:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,now? yes. I'd stick w/ Warty unless you like blood. ;-)
2005-01-29T12:38:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"heh, no blood please."
2005-01-29T12:43:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"if you'd like, I'd build you a bzflag 2.0 deb."
2005-01-29T12:43:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,that would rock bud.
2005-01-29T12:44:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,save me some extreme headaches
2005-01-29T12:46:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,how do I 'un-apt-get source bzflag' heh.
2005-01-29T12:46:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I want to get rid of the old source I just apt-get installed
2005-01-29T12:46:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,just erase it from `pwd`
2005-01-29T12:48:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,actually you can just pull the debs from incoming if you do it _really_ fast-like.
2005-01-29T12:48:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,where?

2005-01-29T14:11:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I may just switch back to 1.4.x
2005-01-29T14:11:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,anything visibly wrong with the program itself?

2005-02-18T08:30:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"heh.  Welll, I don't want to hork my futur upgrades"
2005-02-18T08:30:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,the standard caveat is that the packages from ubuntu-bp are poorly versioned and will cause problems when dist-upgrading from Warty to Hoary.

2005-09-17T16:30:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,you'd have to manually rm -rf those directories in /lib/modules/
2005-09-17T16:31:00.000Z,occy,crimsun, so... root@sometimes:/lib/modules/2.6.10-5-386/drivers/net # pwd
2005-09-17T16:32:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,what dir did those extra kernel modules install into?
2005-09-17T16:32:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I'm guessing that was the dir.  :/
2005-09-17T16:32:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,no way to just purge and then reinstall forcing the original state of things?
2005-09-17T16:33:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I was using a default Ubuntu kernel setup just peachy.
2005-09-17T16:33:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"change out of that dir, then sudo aptitude purge linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r) linux-image-$(uname -r)"
2005-09-17T16:34:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,then sudo rm -rf /lib/modules/$(uname -r)
2005-09-17T16:35:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"yess, done"
2005-09-17T16:35:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,yessir
2005-09-17T16:36:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I've completed those commands.
2005-09-17T16:36:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,was documenting so I can post a mini-howto on my site. ;)
2005-09-17T16:36:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,then sudo apt-get --reinstall install linux-image-$(uname -r) linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r) linux-headers-$(uname -r)
2005-09-17T16:37:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,coolio  doing now
2005-09-17T16:37:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I guess I just need to reboot now?
2005-09-17T16:37:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,yep
2005-09-17T16:37:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,okies bud.  be back in a bit.
2005-09-17T16:37:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,thanks tons.

2005-09-17T16:42:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,gonna go make a 'tips and tricks' post on http://occy.net/ about it.
2005-09-17T16:49:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,http://occy.net/node/142
2005-09-17T16:50:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I might want to include Reboot to be complete.
2005-09-17T16:51:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,thank you again.  I do appreciate all your time and help.
2005-09-17T06:21:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,scroll down
2005-09-17T06:19:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"if Breezy is _that_ broken that a new user has a disastrous experience, then that's a critical issue, and testing will help iron that out before the final release."

2005-09-17T06:20:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"well, good point but... do we really want to displace advocacy with new users as guinie pigs?"

2005-09-17T06:21:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,stable is waaaay down there.

2005-10-18T13:40:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,breezy++
2005-10-18T13:40:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,indeed
2005-10-18T13:40:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,no issues at all this time.
2005-10-18T13:40:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,not 1!
2005-10-18T14:20:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,they nuked the old beep-media-player skin. :(
2005-10-18T14:20:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"(heh, and left the old preview in place for it)"
2005-10-18T14:20:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,I nuked it and didn't update the preview by accident.
2005-10-18T14:20:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"grrr, it's YOU I can blame!%@#%#@%"
2005-10-18T14:21:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,the old theme was inspiration for occy.net !
2005-10-18T14:21:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,which old theme?
2005-10-18T14:21:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,the debian one?
2005-10-18T14:21:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,the old beep-media-player theme.
2005-10-18T14:21:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,nod
2005-10-18T14:21:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,it was better to have a Ubuntu-oriented one (requested)
2005-10-18T14:22:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I can understand that for default...  do you have a copy of the old one?
2005-10-18T14:22:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"it's retrievable from the orig.tar.gz of the Debian tarball, which you'll need to grab from packages.debian.org/beep-media-player"
2005-10-18T14:23:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"k, danke"
2005-10-18T14:27:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"wow, there's another cool skin in there."
2005-10-18T14:27:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I smell a new revision of occy.net coming
2005-10-18T14:27:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,which?
2005-10-18T14:28:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,the blue one?
2005-10-18T14:28:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,sec
2005-10-18T14:28:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,nod
2005-10-18T14:28:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,that's non-free
2005-10-18T14:28:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,the darker blue one
2005-10-18T14:28:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,really?
2005-10-18T14:28:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,that's why the Debian tarball ships the Debian skin as the default. Read README.Debian
2005-10-18T14:29:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"ahhh, well, I've already been 'inspired' by it."
2005-10-18T14:29:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,whatever works :-)
2005-10-18T14:29:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I can't unsee a thing.
2005-10-22T05:36:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"howdy, got anything on sharing printers easily?"
2005-10-22T05:36:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"I don't, sorry. The wiki and mailing list archives?"
2005-10-22T05:48:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"if you like theming, you should check out bmpx 0.12RC11"
2005-10-22T05:48:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,yeah?
2005-10-22T05:48:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,where can I get it?
2005-10-22T05:49:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,http://bmpx.berlios.de
2005-10-22T05:49:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"since we don't have a printing network thing, think you might add this url as a network printing thing for ubotu?  http://occy.net/printing"
2005-10-22T05:49:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I ain't touching ubotu though.  Seveas has me scared.
2005-10-22T05:49:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,slap it onto the bot.
2005-10-22T05:50:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,it'd be nice to get that onto the wikie
2005-10-22T05:50:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I'll try and do that
2005-10-22T05:50:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,then log in and put it on the wiki :-)
2005-10-22T05:50:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,:P~
2005-11-01T13:02:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,heh
2005-11-01T13:02:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,9 days to IMFL
2005-11-01T13:02:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,nice
2005-11-02T13:54:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,:)
2005-11-02T13:54:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,what I wrote for cribbon up above.
2005-11-02T13:55:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"yes, it's compiled as a module"
2005-11-02T13:55:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,so I probably don't want to remove it.
2005-11-02T13:57:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"if you're using sshfs, no you wouldn't want to"
2005-11-02T13:58:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I am getting rid of sshfs  it didn't work.
2005-11-02T13:58:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,so I'm trying to purge unecessary cruft from my system.
2005-11-02T13:58:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,sshfs worked fine when I used it
2005-11-02T13:58:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,wanted to make sure that the fuse-utils wasn't something that came with ubuntu by default
2005-11-02T13:59:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,didn't work for me[tm]     :(
2005-11-02T14:01:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"sorry to hear that, got any diagnostics?"
2005-11-02T14:01:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,pm
2005-11-02T14:01:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"sec, being bombarded..."

2005-11-10T07:04:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,you here?
2005-11-19T07:51:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I am an Ironman!   http://occy.net/ironman
2005-11-19T07:51:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,congrats!
2005-11-19T07:51:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,it was a super fun day.
2005-11-19T07:51:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,14:09:18
2005-11-19T07:52:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"ooh, excellent"
2005-11-19T07:52:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,and I wasn't very tired at the end.
2005-11-19T07:53:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,think it could be my gtk theme?
2005-11-19T07:53:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"hmm, but then it would be manifest across all gtk apps"
2005-11-19T07:53:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I never had problems with it under Hoary though.
2005-11-19T07:53:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,can you reproduce the instability with a new user?
2005-11-19T07:54:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"interesting point, I did copy over my preferences"
2005-11-19T07:54:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"meaning, I used the old ~"
2005-11-19T07:55:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"so you are saying, try and operate as another user, see if I have any problems, if I don't then, it's probably my prefs config files."
2005-11-20T09:54:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,Since nuking my prefs things seem stable with Firefox.
2005-11-20T14:39:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,good to hear
2005-12-07T09:17:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,hey... is there a default char limit on the topic of a channel?
2005-12-07T14:37:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,bad occy. You should not be using that ff deb.
2005-12-07T14:38:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,it's not a deb
2005-12-07T14:38:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,from the offical site?
2005-12-07T14:38:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"heh, it's the tarball"
2005-12-07T14:38:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"oh no, even worse"
2005-12-07T14:38:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,that's the official tarball
2005-12-07T14:38:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"well, I just downloaded it"
2005-12-07T14:38:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,so Ubuntu people are SOL for FF 1.5 ?
2005-12-07T14:39:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"absolutely, until Ian finishes the proper packaging."
2005-12-07T14:39:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,topic says 1.5 won't be in until April when Dapper is released.
2005-12-07T14:41:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"so the bottom line is, 'Wait until April for Dapper Drake to get FF 1.5+?'"
2005-12-07T14:41:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"no. When it enters Dapper, it'll be backported to Breezy."
2005-12-07T14:42:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"i.e., breezy-backports"
2005-12-07T14:42:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I thought backports were bad?  I'm so confused.
2005-12-07T14:42:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,unofficial backports are questionable at best.
2005-12-07T14:42:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,the ones in the -backports repositories hosted on archive.ubuntu.com are fine
2005-12-08T08:04:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"btw, after nuking my personal prefs, it didn't seem to help, as FF started back crashing again not too long afterwards."
2005-12-13T14:20:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,grrr
2005-12-13T14:20:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I nukd all my prefs too
2005-12-13T14:20:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,so that can't be it
2005-12-13T14:21:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,hey btw. :)
2005-12-13T14:21:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,hi
2005-12-13T14:21:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,it really sucks when I'm trying to get work done and stuff just keeps crashing on me for no reason. :(
2005-12-13T14:22:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I'm getting close to just nuking it and trying to use another distro till Dapper comes out.
2005-12-13T14:22:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,you could also be insane and run Dapper like those of us who are insane.
2005-12-13T14:22:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,hehe
2005-12-13T14:22:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"true, it'd probably be no less stable than my setup now."
2005-12-13T14:23:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,good to always see you :)
2005-12-13T14:23:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,ditto
2005-12-13T14:28:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"haven't had any here, but I don't use any extensions"
2005-12-13T14:29:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,hmmm
2005-12-13T14:29:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I wonder... maybe it's the stupid web developer plugin
2005-12-28T08:00:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,heyaz
2005-12-28T08:00:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,h.
2005-12-28T08:00:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,things finally seem somewhat stable
2005-12-28T08:00:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,back on gnome.  heh.
2005-12-28T08:01:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"what I did was, I went into synaptic, and nuked all my entries to my sources.list,  and then added each of the binary options and checked all of the available solutions.  then upgraded and things are stable now."
2005-12-28T08:02:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I bet you there are a lot of people who would do what I didn't do.
2005-12-28T08:02:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,sounds good.
2005-12-28T08:03:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"things got so bad, I nuked my sytem, tried gentoo, tried Suse 10.0, and tried kubuntu.  got fed up and came back to ubuntu and gnome,  figured I'd stick with the bugginess.  But, then I figured that out.  Things have been rock solid for like 4 days."
2005-12-28T08:04:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"anyway, I know you don't lay awake at night worrying about whether or not I am having problems but thought I'd share my thoughts with you. ;)"
2005-12-28T08:05:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,glad to read they've been resolved (fingers crossed)
2005-12-31T10:11:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"howdy, you know how to do the set-selections and get-selections stuff?  I was able to do:  dpkg --get-selections > pkg.txt"
2005-12-31T10:11:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,do I do this in reverse:  dpkg --set-selections < pkg.txt
2005-12-31T10:12:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,it's read from stdin. cat and pipe.
2005-12-31T10:12:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,for the non-programmer that means?
2005-12-31T10:12:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,:)
2005-12-31T10:13:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,cat foo|dpkg [..] 
2005-12-31T10:13:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,ahhhh
2005-12-31T10:19:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"you know about debian-administration.org, correct?"
2005-12-31T10:22:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,what's this?
2005-12-31T10:22:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I'll check it out.
2005-12-31T10:22:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,tx ;)
2006-04-01T07:24:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"heyaz, ltns :)"
2006-04-01T07:24:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I'm going over to the dark side... Got an iMac...
2006-04-01T07:24:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,slick
2005-01-01T16:16:00.000Z,crimsun,,"hey occy, how's the triath training going?"
2005-01-01T16:16:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,did my first 21 miler sunday!
2005-01-01T16:35:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,thanks for asking :)
2005-01-01T16:36:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"np, I remember my own marathon training. :)"
2005-01-01T16:36:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,yeah?
2005-01-01T16:37:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,how come you don't hang out in #fitgeek?
2005-01-01T16:37:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,didn't know of it til just now :)
2005-01-02T17:41:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,what's your lspci line for the sound chipset?
2005-01-02T17:41:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,sec
2005-01-02T17:42:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,lsmod|grep snd_intel8x0
2005-01-02T17:42:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,it found some stuff :)
2005-01-02T17:43:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"a bunch of stuff, should I paste in /msg?"
2005-01-02T17:43:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,or in #flood
2005-01-02T17:43:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,either.
2005-01-02T17:43:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,alsamixer(1) should work
2005-01-02T17:44:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,see it?
2005-01-02T17:44:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"indeed, sec."
2005-01-02T17:45:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,tx sorry to bug you :)
2005-01-02T17:45:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,take your time
2005-01-02T17:45:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,what happens when you use alsamixer?
2005-01-02T17:45:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"actually, have we established that snd-intel8x0 is loaded?"
2005-01-02T17:46:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,#flood again
2005-01-02T17:46:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,there you go.
2005-01-02T17:47:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,and now run alsamixer
2005-01-02T17:48:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,sudo echo 'snd-intel8x0m' >> /etc/hotplug/blacklist
2005-01-02T17:49:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"when you reboot, it should work"
2005-01-02T17:49:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,k... not working atm though after removing that module.  ( ogra )
2005-01-02T17:52:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,occy.net is back up btw.... check out the new changes ;)
2005-01-02T17:55:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,contents of /proc/asound/cards ?
2005-01-02T17:55:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,looking
2005-01-02T17:55:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,no soundcards
2005-01-02T17:55:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,is this a laptop?
2005-01-02T17:56:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,yessir
2005-01-02T17:56:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,dell?
2005-01-02T17:56:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,yup.  Dell inspiron 8200
2005-01-02T17:56:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"reboot, disable the modem and printer port in bios."
2005-01-02T17:56:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,on it 007
2005-01-02T06:00:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,the best thing to do is to use the acpi boot param
2005-01-02T06:00:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,the harder hack is to disable stuff in bios
2005-01-02T06:01:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,the recommended procedure is to use the acpi boot param as outlined in the url ogra pasted.
2005-01-02T06:02:00.000Z,occy,crimsun, ogra tx bunches guys.  You are both a peach. :)
2005-01-02T06:08:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"you're using Warty, correct?"
2005-01-02T06:08:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,yup
2005-01-02T06:09:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"for a permanent solution, sudo $EDITOR /boot/grub/menu.list"
2005-01-02T06:09:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,scroll to the line marked with # kopt=....
2005-01-02T06:09:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,and add the acpi_... to the end
2005-01-02T06:09:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,then run `sudo update-grub'
2005-01-02T06:13:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,it should be at the end of the commented kopt line
2005-01-02T06:14:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,yep. Make sure there's a hash mark at the beginning.
2005-01-02T06:20:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"so whenever you like, drop by #fitgeek ;)"
2005-01-02T06:21:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"oh, have you heard my band yet?  ( ogra too )"
2005-01-02T07:54:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,you have a personal website?
2005-01-02T09:00:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,tx again for your help yesterday evening.
2005-01-02T09:00:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,occy.net (left sidebar)
2005-01-02T09:00:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"np :) No, I don't maintain a web page. Yes, I'm the same one on debianplanet.org et al."
2005-01-02T09:00:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,haha
2005-01-02T09:00:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,you read my mind..
2005-01-02T09:03:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,possibly. Does the jvm tell you which applet fails to init?
2005-01-02T09:03:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"hmmm, is there a console I can initiate or something to ascertain that?"
2005-01-02T09:04:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,sometimes the error is printed in the space on the web page where the applet should have loaded; sometimes it creates a log file in ~
2005-01-02T09:04:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"yep, that works, too."
2005-01-02T09:07:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,does that look bad?
2005-01-02T09:07:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,which jre/jdk are you using?
2005-01-02T09:08:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,hmm. 1.4.x?
2005-01-02T09:08:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,yah... sec
2005-01-02T09:09:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"for the moz-firefox plugin, just the symlink is sufficient"
2005-01-02T09:10:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"right, but if it needs some sort of local system java stuff, won't it need the path to be set?"
2005-01-02T09:10:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"actually in that case, $CLASSPATH would need to be set"
2005-01-02T09:10:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,how can I do that. (man you are a busy guy)
2005-01-02T09:11:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"prepending the $JAVA_HOME/bin path to your $PATH may help, too"
2005-01-02T09:13:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,export PATH=/usr/local/bin/j2re1.4.2/bin:$PATH
2005-01-02T09:18:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,usually I edit /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 and do what Pozac said.
2005-01-02T09:18:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,then `sudo invoke-rc.d gdm restart'
2005-01-02T09:28:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,got the gdm straightened out?
2005-01-02T09:40:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,:/
2005-01-02T09:40:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,can't seem to keep 1024x768 in 24bpp but 1400x1050 does
2005-01-02T09:41:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"in Section 'Screen' of /etc/X11/XF86Config-4, did you modify the Modes line in Depth 24?"
2005-01-02T09:41:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,and you have a 'DefaultDepth 24'?
2005-01-02T09:42:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,what's the Modes line?
2005-01-02T09:44:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,can you alter that to: Modes '1024x768' '1400x1050'
2005-01-03T08:10:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"have you tried jre 1.5.0, for instance?"
2005-01-03T08:11:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,hmmm I am on 1.5.0
2005-01-03T08:13:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,any ideas on a url for 1.5.0?   The java.sun.com site is a nightmare
2005-01-03T08:14:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,sec.
2005-01-03T08:14:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,k bud
2005-01-03T08:14:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp and choose JRE 5.0 Update 1
2005-01-03T08:16:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,got it :)
2005-01-03T08:16:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,did you check out my bands site?
2005-01-03T08:17:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"haven't had time, sorry. I've been working on syllabi."
2005-01-03T08:17:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"ahh, no worries mate."
2005-01-03T08:22:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"gotta do a bit of manual rearranging with the symlink and $PATH, too"
2005-01-03T08:24:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,yeah?
2005-01-03T08:27:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"oh, right.  Sorry, I catch you now."
2005-01-03T07:17:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,around?
2005-01-03T10:12:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"hmm, I don't believe you're supposed to run java_vm directly, but it's good practice to set $JAVA_HOME, to add $JAVA_HOME/bin to your $PATH, and to set $CLASSPATH as well"
2005-01-05T10:11:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,what precisely is broken with it?
2005-01-05T10:11:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,heyaz bud.
2005-01-05T10:11:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"can't launch the java app.  The sad thing is, it's with a company that I can't let anyone have access to it."
2005-01-05T10:12:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"heya. Sorry, my responses will be erratic 'cos I'm at work."
2005-01-05T10:12:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,java can run on other websites just fine.  Yahoo games for example.
2005-01-05T10:12:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,no worries ;)
2005-01-05T12:44:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,depends on what you need to develop
2005-01-05T12:44:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,need to compile latest qemu :)
2005-01-05T12:45:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,I presume you have the 'universe' repo enabled?
2005-01-05T12:45:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"yessir, universe and multiverse"
2005-01-05T12:45:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,`sudo apt-get build-dep qemu'
2005-01-05T12:46:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,that'll build from cvs?
2005-01-05T12:46:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"no, that installs all the necessary packages for you to compile 'qemu'"
2005-01-05T12:46:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,it's up to you to retrieve qemu's source
2005-01-05T12:46:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,sweet
2005-01-05T12:47:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,that is very nice
2005-01-09T07:06:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,better purge the FC1 ;)
2005-01-09T07:06:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,hehe
2005-01-09T07:07:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"trust me, I want to.  I can't seem to get past that one install issue where it hangs when trying to start the installl."
2005-01-09T08:01:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,you here still ?
2005-01-09T08:05:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"yep, still here (sorry, editing a wiki page)"
2005-01-09T08:05:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,np bud.
2005-01-09T08:06:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,really want to get Ubuntu on it. :(
2005-01-09T08:41:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,thankfully it's transparent under Ubuntu
2005-01-09T08:41:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"yah, very nice under Ubuntu."
2005-01-09T08:41:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,burning Hoary atm.
2005-01-09T08:41:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,g'luck
2005-01-09T08:42:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,heh
2005-01-09T08:42:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"I'm out for 1.5 hours, but I'll be back. Feel free to ping me then if you're still awake."
2005-01-09T08:42:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,later bud. ;)
2005-01-13T08:43:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,heyaz bud.  It was pretty good.  We played a private party.
2005-01-13T08:43:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,our band that is.
2005-01-13T08:44:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,cool :)
2005-01-13T08:44:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"nomasteryoda <-- lives near me and has the same laptop.  Going to either swap hard drives for an install, or use his cd."
2005-01-13T08:45:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,excellent :)
2005-01-13T08:46:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,does apt-get update and apt-get dist-upgrade keep your kernel up-to-date.... or do you have to manually do that?
2005-01-13T08:46:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,update & upgrade will do fine
2005-01-13T08:46:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"you're running warty, correct?"
2005-01-13T08:47:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,ahh ok.
2005-01-13T08:47:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,yah... I should probably stick with it instead of hoary.
2005-01-13T08:47:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,or do you feel it might be stable enough?
2005-01-13T08:48:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,not quite stable enough yet
2005-01-13T08:48:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"it tends to be even more bleeding-edge than sid+experimental, which is impressive"
2005-01-13T08:48:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,the cool thing would be... You could have people do voting to say how they feel things are working for them at present.
2005-01-13T08:48:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,hehe
2005-01-13T08:48:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,did that make sense?
2005-01-13T08:49:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,sure.
2005-01-13T08:52:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,ubuntu has me feeling like I'm back in the Linux community again. :)
2005-01-13T08:53:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,are you familiar with apt-listbugs(1) ?
2005-01-13T08:53:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I reckon not buddy.
2005-01-13T08:54:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,it does something in the vein of what you seek for upgrades
2005-01-13T08:54:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,ahhh
2005-01-13T08:54:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"highly, highly recommended in addition to apt-listchanges(8)"
2005-01-13T08:54:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,what does the (1) signify?
2005-01-13T08:55:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,I just use it to denote what type of program it is; sometimes I use it to denote a man page.
2005-01-13T08:55:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"ahhh, nice."
2005-01-13T08:55:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,figured that was what you were hinting at ;)
2005-01-29T12:29:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"if you're absolutely teeting for it, uupdate & family."
2005-01-29T12:29:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,heyaz bud.
2005-01-29T12:29:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"otherwise, wait an afternoon or two and it'll be pulled in."
2005-01-29T12:30:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,family?
2005-01-29T12:30:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"heya, how's life?"
2005-01-29T12:30:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,never heard that term before
2005-01-29T12:31:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"'uupdate' is part of the 'devscripts' package, which you can use to generate the infrastructure for creating a deb from a new upstream source revision."
2005-01-29T12:37:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,are you running Hoary?
2005-01-29T12:37:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,no sir
2005-01-29T12:38:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,hoary horked on me the other day.
2005-01-29T12:38:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,safe to upgrade at the moment?
2005-01-29T12:38:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,now? yes. I'd stick w/ Warty unless you like blood. ;-)
2005-01-29T12:38:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"heh, no blood please."
2005-01-29T12:43:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"if you'd like, I'd build you a bzflag 2.0 deb."
2005-01-29T12:43:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,that would rock bud.
2005-01-29T12:44:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,save me some extreme headaches
2005-01-29T12:46:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,how do I 'un-apt-get source bzflag' heh.
2005-01-29T12:46:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I want to get rid of the old source I just apt-get installed
2005-01-29T12:46:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,just erase it from `pwd`
2005-01-29T12:48:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,actually you can just pull the debs from incoming if you do it _really_ fast-like.
2005-01-29T12:48:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,where?
2005-01-29T12:48:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,msg me
2005-01-29T12:49:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,wget http://incoming.debian.org/bzflag_2.0.0.20050118_i386.deb http://incoming.debian.org/bzflag-server_2.0.0.20050118_i386.deb
2005-01-29T12:49:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,you have less than one minute before the daily run begins ;)

2005-01-29T14:11:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I may just switch back to 1.4.x
2005-01-29T14:11:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,anything visibly wrong with the program itself?

2005-01-30T12:43:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I would think you should be able to get at least 800x600 on it @16bpp
2005-01-30T12:46:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,not necessarily. Paste the log onto pastebin.

2005-02-18T08:30:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"heh.  Welll, I don't want to hork my futur upgrades"
2005-02-18T08:30:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,the standard caveat is that the packages from ubuntu-bp are poorly versioned and will cause problems when dist-upgrading from Warty to Hoary.

2005-07-29T16:38:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,why wouldn't they roll back the version to the previous stable (under a differnt version number)
2005-07-29T16:38:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,that seems like it'd make sense to me.

2005-09-17T16:30:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,keep in mind that purging those packages won't erase the directories into which you've installed additional files
2005-09-17T16:30:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I've only done the dpkg -l thingy for now.
2005-09-17T16:30:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,didn't want to screw up anything.
2005-09-17T16:30:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,you'd have to manually rm -rf those directories in /lib/modules/
2005-09-17T16:31:00.000Z,occy,crimsun, so... root@sometimes:/lib/modules/2.6.10-5-386/drivers/net # pwd

2005-09-17T16:32:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I'm guessing that was the dir.  :/
2005-09-17T16:32:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,no way to just purge and then reinstall forcing the original state of things?
2005-09-17T16:33:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I was using a default Ubuntu kernel setup just peachy.
2005-09-17T16:33:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"change out of that dir, then sudo aptitude purge linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r) linux-image-$(uname -r)"
2005-09-17T16:34:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,then sudo rm -rf /lib/modules/$(uname -r)
2005-09-17T16:35:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"yess, done"
2005-09-17T16:35:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,yessir
2005-09-17T16:36:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I've completed those commands.
2005-09-17T16:36:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,was documenting so I can post a mini-howto on my site. ;)
2005-09-17T16:36:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,then sudo apt-get --reinstall install linux-image-$(uname -r) linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r) linux-headers-$(uname -r)
2005-09-17T16:37:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,coolio  doing now
2005-09-17T16:37:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I guess I just need to reboot now?
2005-09-17T16:37:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,yep
2005-09-17T16:37:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,okies bud.  be back in a bit.
2005-09-17T16:37:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,thanks tons.
2005-09-17T16:38:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,yw
2005-09-17T16:42:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,gonna go make a 'tips and tricks' post on http://occy.net/ about it.
2005-09-17T16:49:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,http://occy.net/node/142
2005-09-17T16:50:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I might want to include Reboot to be complete.
2005-09-17T16:51:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,thank you again.  I do appreciate all your time and help.
2005-09-17T06:21:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,scroll down
2005-09-17T06:19:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"if Breezy is _that_ broken that a new user has a disastrous experience, then that's a critical issue, and testing will help iron that out before the final release."

2005-09-17T06:20:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"well, good point but... do we really want to displace advocacy with new users as guinie pigs?"
2005-09-17T06:21:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"afaict, it's the ONLY listing under Downloads, which is bad"
2005-09-17T06:21:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,stable is waaaay down there.
2005-09-17T06:22:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,watching the Ironman Wisconsin finishers coming in now.

2005-10-18T16:55:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,is breezy out yet?
2005-10-18T13:40:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,breezy++
2005-10-18T13:40:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,indeed
2005-10-18T13:40:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,no issues at all this time.
2005-10-18T13:40:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,not 1!
2005-10-18T14:20:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,they nuked the old beep-media-player skin. :(
2005-10-18T14:20:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"(heh, and left the old preview in place for it)"
2005-10-18T14:20:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,I nuked it and didn't update the preview by accident.
2005-10-18T14:20:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"grrr, it's YOU I can blame!%@#%#@%"
2005-10-18T14:21:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,the old theme was inspiration for occy.net !
2005-10-18T14:21:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,which old theme?
2005-10-18T14:21:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,the debian one?
2005-10-18T14:21:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,the old beep-media-player theme.
2005-10-18T14:21:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,nod
2005-10-18T14:21:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,it was better to have a Ubuntu-oriented one (requested)
2005-10-18T14:22:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I can understand that for default...  do you have a copy of the old one?
2005-10-18T14:22:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"it's retrievable from the orig.tar.gz of the Debian tarball, which you'll need to grab from packages.debian.org/beep-media-player"
2005-10-18T14:23:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"k, danke"
2005-10-18T14:27:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"wow, there's another cool skin in there."
2005-10-18T14:27:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I smell a new revision of occy.net coming
2005-10-18T14:27:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,which?
2005-10-18T14:28:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,the blue one?
2005-10-18T14:28:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,sec
2005-10-18T14:28:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,nod
2005-10-18T14:28:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,that's non-free
2005-10-18T14:28:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,the darker blue one
2005-10-18T14:28:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,really?
2005-10-18T14:28:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,that's why the Debian tarball ships the Debian skin as the default. Read README.Debian
2005-10-18T14:29:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"ahhh, well, I've already been 'inspired' by it."
2005-10-18T14:29:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,whatever works :-)
2005-10-18T14:29:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I can't unsee a thing.
2005-10-22T05:36:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"howdy, got anything on sharing printers easily?"
2005-10-22T05:36:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"I don't, sorry. The wiki and mailing list archives?"
2005-10-22T05:48:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"if you like theming, you should check out bmpx 0.12RC11"
2005-10-22T05:48:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,yeah?
2005-10-22T05:48:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,where can I get it?
2005-10-22T05:49:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,http://bmpx.berlios.de
2005-10-22T05:49:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"since we don't have a printing network thing, think you might add this url as a network printing thing for ubotu?  http://occy.net/printing"
2005-10-22T05:49:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I ain't touching ubotu though.  Seveas has me scared.
2005-10-22T05:49:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,slap it onto the bot.
2005-10-22T05:50:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,it'd be nice to get that onto the wikie
2005-10-22T05:50:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I'll try and do that
2005-10-22T05:50:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,then log in and put it on the wiki :-)
2005-10-22T05:50:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,:P~
2005-11-01T13:02:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,heh
2005-11-01T13:02:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,9 days to IMFL
2005-11-01T13:02:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,nice
2005-11-02T13:54:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,:)
2005-11-02T13:54:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,what I wrote for cribbon up above.
2005-11-02T13:55:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"yes, it's compiled as a module"
2005-11-02T13:55:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,so I probably don't want to remove it.
2005-11-02T13:57:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"if you're using sshfs, no you wouldn't want to"
2005-11-02T13:58:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I am getting rid of sshfs  it didn't work.
2005-11-02T13:58:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,so I'm trying to purge unecessary cruft from my system.
2005-11-02T13:58:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,sshfs worked fine when I used it
2005-11-02T13:58:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,wanted to make sure that the fuse-utils wasn't something that came with ubuntu by default
2005-11-02T13:59:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,didn't work for me[tm]     :(
2005-11-02T14:01:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"sorry to hear that, got any diagnostics?"
2005-11-02T14:01:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,pm
2005-11-02T14:01:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"sec, being bombarded..."
2005-11-02T14:03:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,hahaha

2005-11-10T07:04:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,you here?
2005-11-19T07:51:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I am an Ironman!   http://occy.net/ironman
2005-11-19T07:51:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,congrats!
2005-11-19T07:51:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,it was a super fun day.
2005-11-19T07:51:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,14:09:18
2005-11-19T07:52:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"ooh, excellent"
2005-11-19T07:52:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,and I wasn't very tired at the end.
2005-11-19T07:53:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,think it could be my gtk theme?
2005-11-19T07:53:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"hmm, but then it would be manifest across all gtk apps"
2005-11-19T07:53:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I never had problems with it under Hoary though.
2005-11-19T07:53:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,can you reproduce the instability with a new user?
2005-11-19T07:54:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"interesting point, I did copy over my preferences"
2005-11-19T07:54:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"meaning, I used the old ~"
2005-11-19T07:55:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"so you are saying, try and operate as another user, see if I have any problems, if I don't then, it's probably my prefs config files."
2005-11-20T09:54:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,Since nuking my prefs things seem stable with Firefox.
2005-11-20T14:39:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,good to hear
2005-12-07T09:17:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,hey... is there a default char limit on the topic of a channel?
2005-12-07T14:37:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,bad occy. You should not be using that ff deb.
2005-12-07T14:38:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,it's not a deb
2005-12-07T14:38:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,from the offical site?
2005-12-07T14:38:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"heh, it's the tarball"
2005-12-07T14:38:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"oh no, even worse"
2005-12-07T14:38:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,that's the official tarball
2005-12-07T14:38:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"well, I just downloaded it"
2005-12-07T14:38:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,so Ubuntu people are SOL for FF 1.5 ?
2005-12-07T14:39:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"absolutely, until Ian finishes the proper packaging."
2005-12-07T14:39:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,topic says 1.5 won't be in until April when Dapper is released.
2005-12-07T14:41:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"so the bottom line is, 'Wait until April for Dapper Drake to get FF 1.5+?'"
2005-12-07T14:41:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"no. When it enters Dapper, it'll be backported to Breezy."
2005-12-07T14:42:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"i.e., breezy-backports"
2005-12-07T14:42:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I thought backports were bad?  I'm so confused.
2005-12-07T14:42:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,unofficial backports are questionable at best.
2005-12-07T14:42:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,the ones in the -backports repositories hosted on archive.ubuntu.com are fine
2005-12-08T08:04:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"btw, after nuking my personal prefs, it didn't seem to help, as FF started back crashing again not too long afterwards."
2005-12-13T14:20:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,grrr
2005-12-13T14:20:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I nukd all my prefs too
2005-12-13T14:20:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,so that can't be it
2005-12-13T14:21:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,hey btw. :)
2005-12-13T14:21:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,hi
2005-12-13T14:21:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,it really sucks when I'm trying to get work done and stuff just keeps crashing on me for no reason. :(
2005-12-13T14:22:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I'm getting close to just nuking it and trying to use another distro till Dapper comes out.
2005-12-13T14:22:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,you could also be insane and run Dapper like those of us who are insane.
2005-12-13T14:22:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,hehe
2005-12-13T14:22:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"true, it'd probably be no less stable than my setup now."
2005-12-13T14:23:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,good to always see you :)
2005-12-13T14:23:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,ditto
2005-12-13T14:28:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"haven't had any here, but I don't use any extensions"
2005-12-13T14:29:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,hmmm
2005-12-13T14:29:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I wonder... maybe it's the stupid web developer plugin
2005-12-28T08:00:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,heyaz
2005-12-28T08:00:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,h.
2005-12-28T08:00:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,things finally seem somewhat stable
2005-12-28T08:00:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,back on gnome.  heh.
2005-12-28T08:01:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"what I did was, I went into synaptic, and nuked all my entries to my sources.list,  and then added each of the binary options and checked all of the available solutions.  then upgraded and things are stable now."
2005-12-28T08:02:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I bet you there are a lot of people who would do what I didn't do.
2005-12-28T08:02:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,sounds good.
2005-12-28T08:03:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"things got so bad, I nuked my sytem, tried gentoo, tried Suse 10.0, and tried kubuntu.  got fed up and came back to ubuntu and gnome,  figured I'd stick with the bugginess.  But, then I figured that out.  Things have been rock solid for like 4 days."
2005-12-28T08:04:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"anyway, I know you don't lay awake at night worrying about whether or not I am having problems but thought I'd share my thoughts with you. ;)"
2005-12-28T08:05:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,glad to read they've been resolved (fingers crossed)
2005-12-31T10:11:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"howdy, you know how to do the set-selections and get-selections stuff?  I was able to do:  dpkg --get-selections > pkg.txt"
2005-12-31T10:11:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,do I do this in reverse:  dpkg --set-selections < pkg.txt
2005-12-31T10:12:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,it's read from stdin. cat and pipe.
2005-12-31T10:12:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,for the non-programmer that means?
2005-12-31T10:12:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,:)
2005-12-31T10:13:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,cat foo|dpkg [..] 
2005-12-31T10:13:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,ahhhh
2005-12-31T10:19:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,"you know about debian-administration.org, correct?"
2005-12-31T10:22:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,what's this?
2005-12-31T10:22:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I'll check it out.
2005-12-31T10:22:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,tx ;)
2006-04-01T07:24:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,"heyaz, ltns :)"
2006-04-01T07:24:00.000Z,occy,crimsun,I'm going over to the dark side... Got an iMac...
2006-04-01T07:24:00.000Z,crimsun,occy,slick
