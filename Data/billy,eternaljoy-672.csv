2007-03-21T13:59:00.000Z,eternaljoy,,i did an update and upgrade and now I have no sound.  How can I fix this please?
2007-03-21T13:59:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,the kernel must have updated.  Did you have to tweak stuff before to get the sound owrking?
2007-03-21T13:59:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,no
2007-03-21T14:00:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,what can I do now?
2007-03-21T14:00:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,"what sort of audio device do you have?  If you don't know, type `lspci` in a terminal and look for your audio device."
2007-03-21T14:02:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,there's a link in ubuntuforums.org.  just a sec.
2007-03-21T14:02:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,whats pastebin can I use to show you?
2007-03-21T14:02:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/11398/
2007-03-21T14:03:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,shold I update to alsa-driver 1.0.13?
2007-03-21T14:03:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy," you just need to download the latest alsa drivers, that's all.  worked for me at least."
2007-03-21T14:03:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy, 1.0.12 worked for me.
2007-03-21T14:03:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy, how?
2007-03-21T14:03:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,one sec.

2007-03-21T14:04:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy, ok ty
2007-03-21T14:04:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,did you see my pastebin result?
2007-03-21T14:04:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,yeah.  you have the identical one that i have.
2007-03-21T14:05:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HdaIntelSoundHowto
2007-03-21T14:05:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,so that website worked for you?
2007-03-21T14:05:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,like a charm.
2007-03-21T14:06:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,do I type: sudo apt-get install build-essential ncurses-dev ?
2007-03-21T14:07:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,"yeah.  just follow those instructions.  be sure not to mix the 1.0.12 stuff with the 1.0.13 stuff, and be sure to adjust the commands for 1.0.12.  it's only a matter of changing one number."
2007-03-21T14:10:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,"i rebooted for the third time and now sound works.  I didnt even have to follow that website.  What on earth causes this?  Why does sond work sometimes, and not other times?"
2007-03-21T14:11:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,does the sound die when you try to adjust the volume?
2007-03-21T14:11:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,what adhjustment?
2007-03-21T14:11:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,"when you increase the volume or anything, does it die?"
2007-03-21T14:12:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy, no it doesnt
2007-03-21T14:12:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy, any ideas?
2007-03-21T14:13:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy, the sound just dies for not explicable reason?
2007-03-21T14:13:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,oh.  you're running Feisty.  Could be anything.
2007-03-21T14:13:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,may be a bug in Feisty.  give it time (the 19th) and see if everything is squared away by then.
2007-03-21T14:14:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,"never!  the sound works great therought the wholw day edgy is running.  Its just that no sound happens when I first turn on my PC in the morning, and I ghave to reboot 3-5 times to get sound workoing"
2007-03-21T14:14:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,"I don't know.  Since Feisty is still in alpha, it may be anything."
2007-03-21T14:14:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,im using Edgy
2007-03-21T14:15:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy, I never said I use feisty
2007-03-21T14:15:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,"oh.  sorry.   try following the instructions on that link anyway.  it'll probably help.  it's been updated, too, so just follow them verbatim, i.e. copy/paste them into a terminal."
2007-03-21T14:15:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,im worried that link may make sound totally stop working for good
2007-03-21T14:16:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy, try not to worry.  it won't do that.
2007-03-21T14:16:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,you cant guratntee that :P
2007-03-21T14:16:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,is there any way of taking a snapshot of his system is now and rollback in case it does?
2007-03-21T14:16:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,"and you're not guaranteed your sound issue will ever be resolved, either."
2007-03-21T14:17:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,I think so.  watch the bot.
2007-03-21T14:17:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy, that website says: f your boot hangs on loading the module for snd-hda-intel.  But this doesnt apply to me
2007-03-21T14:17:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy, I know how to back up the whole system
2007-03-21T14:17:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,neither did mine.  but it resolved my sound issue.
2007-03-21T14:17:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,im talking about a little snapshot
2007-03-21T14:18:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy, yeah but you  never had sound at all.  But I get sound every 3-5 reboots :P
2007-03-21T14:18:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,when did I say that?
2007-03-21T14:19:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,ok im ready :)  can you help me through it?

2007-03-21T15:11:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,has this problem got anything to do with what crimsun said?
2007-03-21T15:12:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,maybe.  worked fine for me though.
2007-03-21T15:12:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy, :((((
2007-03-21T15:13:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,"at least before I had sound when I rebooted a few times.  And I asked you if this can make it totally stop working all togetjer, and I trusted you as you said THAT WONT HAPPEN :("
2007-03-21T15:13:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,now I cant get sound at all :(
2007-03-21T15:14:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,and when  I type alsamixer it says: alsamixer: function snd_mixer_load failed: Invalid argument
2007-03-21T15:15:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,i trusted you :(  and now my sound is stuffed
2007-03-21T15:15:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,one sec.
2007-03-21T15:15:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,ok
2007-03-21T15:18:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,"when I ran sudo alsaconf, it didnt run any mixer or volume control"
2007-03-21T15:19:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,not sure why alsaconf is returning an error.  those wiki instructions have worked well for myself and others.  i'm looking into the error now.  please be patient.
2007-03-21T15:20:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,"when I ran sudo alsaconf, it didnt run any mixer or volume control,  but it didnt give an error; it only says: Now ALSA is ready to use."
2007-03-21T15:21:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,i meant `alsamixer`.
2007-03-21T15:21:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,and why does the volume control now jumps up and down when I try to move it?
2007-03-21T15:21:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,yeah it says: alsamixer: function snd_mixer_load failed: Invalid argument
2007-03-21T15:21:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,something went wrong
2007-03-21T15:21:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,shall I try to reboot?
2007-03-21T15:22:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy, you're sure there's no alternative in the dropdown box in the preferences of the volume manager?
2007-03-21T15:22:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,how can I get it back to the way it was?  at last sound worked when I rebooted a fw times
2007-03-21T15:22:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,it only has 1 option; says Realtec ALC660 (OSS mixer)!  NO other option
2007-03-21T15:23:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,I right click on sound icon and chose Preferences.  but there is only 1 options there; Realtec ALC660 (OSS mixer)
2007-03-21T15:24:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,i was worried about this happening. I should have kept it as it was :(
2007-03-21T15:25:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,is there any way or returning to how it was?
2007-03-21T15:26:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,go to System > Preferences > Sound.
2007-03-21T15:26:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,im there now
2007-03-21T15:26:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,now?
2007-03-21T15:27:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy," in the Sound Playback drop down box, is there an ALSA option?"
2007-03-21T15:27:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,yes ALSA linux achetucuter
2007-03-21T15:28:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,says ALSA Advanced Linux Sound Acrhitcutre
2007-03-21T15:28:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,select ALSA and click TEST.
2007-03-21T15:28:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy, TEST has no sound at all
2007-03-21T15:29:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,so what happens now? :(
2007-03-21T15:29:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,click the Sounds tab.  look at the bottom at the Default sound card.  Is it HDA Intel?
2007-03-21T15:30:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,yes Default Card HDA Intel
2007-03-21T15:30:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,ok good.
2007-03-21T15:30:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,good? LOL   but sound is broken
2007-03-21T15:31:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,it's ONE thing.  go back to Devices and select everything to ALSA.
2007-03-21T15:31:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,any other ideas befoire I cry and have to wipe who Edgy which took me 3 weeks to set up :(
2007-03-21T15:31:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,ok
2007-03-21T15:31:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,just relax.  don't do that.
2007-03-21T15:31:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,let me try a quick reboot first
2007-03-21T15:31:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,ill be back in 1mins
2007-03-21T15:31:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,ok
2007-03-21T15:33:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,what wit the sound?
2007-03-21T15:33:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,u said change what?
2007-03-21T15:34:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,System > Preferences > Sound .  ALSA for all.
2007-03-21T15:34:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,i did that
2007-03-21T15:34:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,and why does the sound bar jump up and down wildly when I try to slide it?
2007-03-21T15:35:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,check the Sound Manager > Preferences again.  It does that because your sound is configured to use ALSA and the volume manager is set to OSS.
2007-03-21T15:35:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,mine used to do the same thing.
2007-03-21T15:35:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,heck the Sound Manager > Preferences again????
2007-03-21T15:35:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,"worth a shot, eh?"
2007-03-21T15:35:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,why?  it still shows the same
2007-03-21T15:36:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,ok.  just checking.
2007-03-21T15:36:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,what have u done to me? :(
2007-03-21T15:36:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,you caused some conflict
2007-03-21T15:37:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,what am I going to do now?  i spent 3-4 weeks setting this system up :(
2007-03-21T15:38:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,you screwed me over dude :(
2007-03-21T15:39:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,just relax.  `gksudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base`
2007-03-21T15:39:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,"I told you i was worried doing that as it may make sound totally stop working!  and you said NO WAY, it wont do that"
2007-03-21T15:39:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,ok im terying to be relaxed :P
2007-03-21T15:39:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,ok loaded. now?
2007-03-21T15:39:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy, you're going to add a line to that file.
2007-03-21T15:40:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,want me to copy ans pastebin the whole file?
2007-03-21T15:40:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,ok whuch line?
2007-03-21T15:41:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy," we're going to try a couple of different flavours, which will take a couple of reboots to see if we've gotten the right one.  it'll take a couple of steps, so please be patient."
2007-03-21T15:41:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,"im trying, ok"
2007-03-21T15:41:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,what next then?
2007-03-21T15:41:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,add this line `options snd-hda-intel model=3stack`.
2007-03-21T15:41:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,that file is loaded: gksudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base
2007-03-21T15:42:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,ad it anywhwre?
2007-03-21T15:42:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,ok done. reboot now?

2007-03-21T15:42:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,ok brb
2007-03-21T15:45:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,no sound :(
2007-03-21T15:45:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,what now?
2007-03-21T15:45:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,we're going to try different flavours.  `gksudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base`
2007-03-21T15:46:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,ok delete the loine we added before?
2007-03-21T15:46:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,no.  simply replace '3stack' with 'm2-2'.
2007-03-21T15:47:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,ok rebooting
2007-03-21T15:49:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,no sound :(
2007-03-21T15:49:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,what now?
2007-03-21T15:49:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy," again, we're going to try a different flavour.  `gksudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base`"
2007-03-21T15:49:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,now?
2007-03-21T15:50:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,replace the m2-2 with 5stack.
2007-03-21T15:50:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,5stack. ?  with . on end?
2007-03-21T15:50:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,no.  no .
2007-03-21T16:00:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy, notebook eh?  that'd been pertinent.
2007-03-22T16:01:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,my sound worked perfect before.  the only prob I had was I needed to reboot 2-3 times before sound worked
2007-03-22T16:05:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,hope everything gets working right.  sorry I hosed your system.
2007-03-22T16:06:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,"its not what you do that counts, in the intent beghind it. and your intention were good.  ty anyway"
2007-03-22T15:46:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,im using 50000 for purposes here
2007-03-22T14:43:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,hello. thanksd for trying to help me and my sound earlier
2007-03-22T14:43:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,I hope you didnt feel too bad
2007-03-22T14:43:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,i'm still bummed over that.
2007-03-22T14:43:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,ever get it working?
2007-03-22T14:43:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,"no, pls dont be.  your intent was good and you tried very hard. its not what we do that counts as much as the intent behind it"
2007-03-22T14:44:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,i got it working again by reinstalling the sound drivers from default edgy install
2007-03-22T14:44:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,so i got sound again. so dont worry :)
2007-03-22T14:44:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,good.  still having to reboot to get the sound?
2007-03-22T14:45:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,crimsun gave me a command that put sound drivers back as it was.  and now i have sound.  the only bummer is that I have to reload ubuntu a few times to get sound. but i can live with it :P
2007-03-22T14:45:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,"yeah, a few times.  but sometimes im lucky and it works first boot"
2007-03-22T14:45:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,"well, that sucks, in my humble opinion.  you're wearing out your system just to get freakin' sound."
2007-03-22T14:45:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,"sometimes it works first boot, and others the 2nd or third boot"
2007-03-22T14:46:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,i have no choice :(   im not going to try to insyall anything again after 3 hours today :P
2007-03-22T14:46:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,i don't blame you.
2007-03-22T14:46:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,ill have to live with it
2007-03-22T14:46:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,"as i said, sometimes im lucky and it works first boot. eg, tonight i turned it on and sound worked first time :)"
2007-03-22T14:47:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,thanks a lot for today.  you were very patient and tried your best to help me.  i deeply appreciate it
2007-03-22T14:47:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy," thanks.  but I still feel like I totally burned you.  I still have an idea, but I think we're both a little burnt out on it."
2007-03-22T14:48:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy, is ALSA what you're using now?
2007-03-22T14:49:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,"well you didnt burn me as I said earlier, its your intent that counts.  you didnt purposely try to burn me. its was just an affect of good will."
2007-03-22T14:49:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,"the only thing different is when I right click on speaker icon and chose Preferences, it now has HDA intel Salsa mixer selceted"
2007-03-22T14:49:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,thanks for that.  really helps.  just curious.  is ALSA what's driving your sound?
2007-03-22T14:49:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,"after what we did, that wasnt available. and thats what causesd no sound I think"
2007-03-22T14:51:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,it says Salsa
2007-03-22T14:52:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,"when I right click on speaker icon and chose Preferences, it now has HDA intel Salsa mixer selceted"
2007-03-22T14:52:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,that wasnt there before
2007-03-22T14:52:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy, that's good.  at least it's using ALSA now.
2007-03-22T14:54:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy, I still think that adding a `options snd-hda-intel model=laptop` to `/etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base` may help though.  It'd be really easy to delete the line if it didn't work.
2007-03-22T14:55:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,what does options snd-hda-intel model=laptop do?
2007-03-22T14:55:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,we never tried that
2007-03-22T14:55:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,"tells your setup that you've got a laptop, basically."
2007-03-22T14:56:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,im too scared to change anything again :P
2007-03-22T14:56:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy, well.  it's a far easier fix (just delete the line) than having to re-install modules.  :)
2007-03-22T14:59:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,have you opened it FTP *and* SMTP?
2007-03-22T14:59:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,its ktorrent port
2007-03-22T15:00:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,i think its called UDP or something
2007-03-22T15:00:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy, there's an option especially for torrent programs in the drop down menu.
2007-03-22T15:00:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,what drop dwn menu?
2007-03-22T15:02:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,when you go to 'Add Rule' for Allow Service.
2007-03-22T15:03:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,in ktorrent?
2007-03-22T15:03:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy, your firewall is blocking ktorrent right?
2007-03-22T15:04:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,"no!  seems my router. because when I close firewall, it says its closed"
2007-03-22T15:04:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,"oh, sorry.  I misunderstood."
2007-03-22T15:04:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,I added to firewall anyway
2007-03-22T15:04:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,"so when firewall is closed, its still closed the port.  but I port forwared it on my router.  im confused"
2007-03-22T15:05:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,i've never worked with a router.  sorry i can't help you there.
2007-03-22T15:21:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,you a gang banger? :P
2007-03-22T15:23:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,wheee u from?
2007-03-22T15:26:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,I'm from the USA.
2007-03-22T15:45:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,be careful about naming ports in open forums.
2007-03-22T15:46:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,its not my proper port :)  i know
2007-03-22T15:47:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,u want it?
2007-03-22T15:47:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,I have the gparted live cd ISO
2007-03-22T15:48:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,"I have gparted live on disc.  i'm all good, over here."
2007-03-22T15:49:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,ok :)
2007-03-24T07:06:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,hello there :)
2007-03-24T07:07:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,"something weird happened.  now every single time I boot Ubuntu, sound works"
2007-03-24T07:07:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,"so mayne something you and I did, helped that to happen. :) so thanks :)"
2007-03-24T07:08:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy," it was probably just an initial install bug or something.  glad it's worked out for you.  ALSA wasn't even installed, so what we did ~may~ have helped."
2007-03-24T07:08:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,"it was annyoing havint to boot Ubuntu 2-3 times to get sound., but that doesnt happen anymore"
2007-03-24T07:08:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,plus you were wearing out your hardware doing that.  not cool.
2007-03-24T07:08:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,yeah. and wghats your prob today?
2007-03-24T07:08:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,"booting ubuntu wears out my hardware?  not much though, right?"
2007-03-24T07:09:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,"well, booting over and over again into wears it out faster, no matter what OS you're running."
2007-03-21T13:59:00.000Z,eternaljoy,,i did an update and upgrade and now I have no sound.  How can I fix this please?
2007-03-21T13:59:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,the kernel must have updated.  Did you have to tweak stuff before to get the sound owrking?
2007-03-21T13:59:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,no
2007-03-21T14:00:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,what can I do now?
2007-03-21T14:00:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,"what sort of audio device do you have?  If you don't know, type `lspci` in a terminal and look for your audio device."
2007-03-21T14:02:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,there's a link in ubuntuforums.org.  just a sec.
2007-03-21T14:02:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,whats pastebin can I use to show you?
2007-03-21T14:02:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/11398/
2007-03-21T14:03:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,shold I update to alsa-driver 1.0.13?
2007-03-21T14:03:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy," you just need to download the latest alsa drivers, that's all.  worked for me at least."
2007-03-21T14:03:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy, 1.0.12 worked for me.
2007-03-21T14:03:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy, how?
2007-03-21T14:03:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,one sec.

2007-03-21T14:04:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,yeah.  you have the identical one that i have.
2007-03-21T14:05:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HdaIntelSoundHowto
2007-03-21T14:05:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,so that website worked for you?
2007-03-21T14:05:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,like a charm.
2007-03-21T14:06:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,do I type: sudo apt-get install build-essential ncurses-dev ?
2007-03-21T14:07:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,"yeah.  just follow those instructions.  be sure not to mix the 1.0.12 stuff with the 1.0.13 stuff, and be sure to adjust the commands for 1.0.12.  it's only a matter of changing one number."
2007-03-21T14:10:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,"i rebooted for the third time and now sound works.  I didnt even have to follow that website.  What on earth causes this?  Why does sond work sometimes, and not other times?"
2007-03-21T14:11:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,does the sound die when you try to adjust the volume?
2007-03-21T14:11:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,what adhjustment?
2007-03-21T14:11:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,"when you increase the volume or anything, does it die?"
2007-03-21T14:12:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy, no it doesnt
2007-03-21T14:12:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy, any ideas?
2007-03-21T14:13:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy, the sound just dies for not explicable reason?
2007-03-21T14:13:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,oh.  you're running Feisty.  Could be anything.
2007-03-21T14:13:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,may be a bug in Feisty.  give it time (the 19th) and see if everything is squared away by then.
2007-03-21T14:14:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,"never!  the sound works great therought the wholw day edgy is running.  Its just that no sound happens when I first turn on my PC in the morning, and I ghave to reboot 3-5 times to get sound workoing"
2007-03-21T14:14:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,"I don't know.  Since Feisty is still in alpha, it may be anything."
2007-03-21T14:14:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,im using Edgy
2007-03-21T14:15:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy, I never said I use feisty
2007-03-21T14:15:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,"oh.  sorry.   try following the instructions on that link anyway.  it'll probably help.  it's been updated, too, so just follow them verbatim, i.e. copy/paste them into a terminal."
2007-03-21T14:15:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,im worried that link may make sound totally stop working for good
2007-03-21T14:16:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy, try not to worry.  it won't do that.
2007-03-21T14:16:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,you cant guratntee that :P
2007-03-21T14:16:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,is there any way of taking a snapshot of his system is now and rollback in case it does?
2007-03-21T14:16:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,"and you're not guaranteed your sound issue will ever be resolved, either."
2007-03-21T14:17:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,I think so.  watch the bot.
2007-03-21T14:17:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy, that website says: f your boot hangs on loading the module for snd-hda-intel.  But this doesnt apply to me
2007-03-21T14:17:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy, I know how to back up the whole system
2007-03-21T14:17:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,neither did mine.  but it resolved my sound issue.
2007-03-21T14:17:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,im talking about a little snapshot
2007-03-21T14:18:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy, yeah but you  never had sound at all.  But I get sound every 3-5 reboots :P
2007-03-21T14:18:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,when did I say that?
2007-03-21T14:19:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,ok im ready :)  can you help me through it?

2007-03-21T15:11:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,and now the volume controls is misbehaving.  it jumps up and down when I try to move it
2007-03-21T15:11:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,has this problem got anything to do with what crimsun said?

2007-03-21T15:12:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy, :((((

2007-03-21T15:19:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,not sure why alsaconf is returning an error.  those wiki instructions have worked well for myself and others.  i'm looking into the error now.  please be patient.
2007-03-21T15:20:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,"when I ran sudo alsaconf, it didnt run any mixer or volume control,  but it didnt give an error; it only says: Now ALSA is ready to use."
2007-03-21T15:21:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,i meant `alsamixer`.
2007-03-21T15:21:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,and why does the volume control now jumps up and down when I try to move it?
2007-03-21T15:21:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,yeah it says: alsamixer: function snd_mixer_load failed: Invalid argument
2007-03-21T15:21:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,something went wrong
2007-03-21T15:21:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,shall I try to reboot?
2007-03-21T15:22:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy, you're sure there's no alternative in the dropdown box in the preferences of the volume manager?
2007-03-21T15:22:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,how can I get it back to the way it was?  at last sound worked when I rebooted a fw times
2007-03-21T15:22:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,it only has 1 option; says Realtec ALC660 (OSS mixer)!  NO other option
2007-03-21T15:23:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,I right click on sound icon and chose Preferences.  but there is only 1 options there; Realtec ALC660 (OSS mixer)
2007-03-21T15:24:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,i was worried about this happening. I should have kept it as it was :(
2007-03-21T15:25:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,is there any way or returning to how it was?
2007-03-21T15:26:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,go to System > Preferences > Sound.
2007-03-21T15:26:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,im there now
2007-03-21T15:26:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,now?
2007-03-21T15:27:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy," in the Sound Playback drop down box, is there an ALSA option?"
2007-03-21T15:27:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,yes ALSA linux achetucuter
2007-03-21T15:28:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,says ALSA Advanced Linux Sound Acrhitcutre
2007-03-21T15:28:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,select ALSA and click TEST.
2007-03-21T15:28:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy, TEST has no sound at all
2007-03-21T15:29:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,so what happens now? :(
2007-03-21T15:29:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,click the Sounds tab.  look at the bottom at the Default sound card.  Is it HDA Intel?
2007-03-21T15:30:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,yes Default Card HDA Intel
2007-03-21T15:30:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,ok good.
2007-03-21T15:30:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,good? LOL   but sound is broken
2007-03-21T15:31:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,it's ONE thing.  go back to Devices and select everything to ALSA.
2007-03-21T15:31:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,any other ideas befoire I cry and have to wipe who Edgy which took me 3 weeks to set up :(
2007-03-21T15:31:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,ok
2007-03-21T15:31:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,just relax.  don't do that.
2007-03-21T15:31:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,let me try a quick reboot first
2007-03-21T15:31:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,ill be back in 1mins
2007-03-21T15:31:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,ok
2007-03-21T15:33:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,what wit the sound?
2007-03-21T15:33:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,u said change what?
2007-03-21T15:34:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,System > Preferences > Sound .  ALSA for all.
2007-03-21T15:34:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,i did that
2007-03-21T15:34:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,and why does the sound bar jump up and down wildly when I try to slide it?
2007-03-21T15:35:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,check the Sound Manager > Preferences again.  It does that because your sound is configured to use ALSA and the volume manager is set to OSS.
2007-03-21T15:35:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,mine used to do the same thing.
2007-03-21T15:35:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,heck the Sound Manager > Preferences again????
2007-03-21T15:35:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,"worth a shot, eh?"
2007-03-21T15:35:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,why?  it still shows the same
2007-03-21T15:36:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,ok.  just checking.
2007-03-21T15:36:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,what have u done to me? :(
2007-03-21T15:36:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,you caused some conflict
2007-03-21T15:37:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,what am I going to do now?  i spent 3-4 weeks setting this system up :(
2007-03-21T15:38:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,you screwed me over dude :(
2007-03-21T15:39:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,just relax.  `gksudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base`
2007-03-21T15:39:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,"I told you i was worried doing that as it may make sound totally stop working!  and you said NO WAY, it wont do that"
2007-03-21T15:39:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,ok im terying to be relaxed :P
2007-03-21T15:39:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,ok loaded. now?
2007-03-21T15:39:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy, you're going to add a line to that file.
2007-03-21T15:40:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,want me to copy ans pastebin the whole file?
2007-03-21T15:40:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,ok whuch line?
2007-03-21T15:41:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy," we're going to try a couple of different flavours, which will take a couple of reboots to see if we've gotten the right one.  it'll take a couple of steps, so please be patient."
2007-03-21T15:41:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,"im trying, ok"
2007-03-21T15:41:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,what next then?
2007-03-21T15:41:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,add this line `options snd-hda-intel model=3stack`.
2007-03-21T15:41:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,that file is loaded: gksudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base
2007-03-21T15:42:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,ad it anywhwre?
2007-03-21T15:42:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,ok done. reboot now?
2007-03-21T15:42:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,save the file and reboot.
2007-03-21T15:42:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,ok brb
2007-03-21T15:45:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,no sound :(
2007-03-21T15:45:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,what now?
2007-03-21T15:45:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,we're going to try different flavours.  `gksudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base`
2007-03-21T15:46:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,ok delete the loine we added before?
2007-03-21T15:46:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,no.  simply replace '3stack' with 'm2-2'.
2007-03-21T15:47:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,ok rebooting
2007-03-21T15:49:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,no sound :(
2007-03-21T15:49:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,what now?
2007-03-21T15:49:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy," again, we're going to try a different flavour.  `gksudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base`"
2007-03-21T15:49:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,now?
2007-03-21T15:50:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,replace the m2-2 with 5stack.
2007-03-21T15:50:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,5stack. ?  with . on end?
2007-03-21T15:50:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,no.  no .
2007-03-21T16:00:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy, notebook eh?  that'd been pertinent.
2007-03-22T16:01:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,my sound worked perfect before.  the only prob I had was I needed to reboot 2-3 times before sound worked
2007-03-22T16:05:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,hope everything gets working right.  sorry I hosed your system.
2007-03-22T16:06:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,"its not what you do that counts, in the intent beghind it. and your intention were good.  ty anyway"
2007-03-22T15:46:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,im using 50000 for purposes here
2007-03-22T14:43:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,hello. thanksd for trying to help me and my sound earlier
2007-03-22T14:43:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,I hope you didnt feel too bad
2007-03-22T14:43:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,i'm still bummed over that.
2007-03-22T14:43:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,ever get it working?
2007-03-22T14:43:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,"no, pls dont be.  your intent was good and you tried very hard. its not what we do that counts as much as the intent behind it"
2007-03-22T14:44:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,i got it working again by reinstalling the sound drivers from default edgy install
2007-03-22T14:44:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,so i got sound again. so dont worry :)
2007-03-22T14:44:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,good.  still having to reboot to get the sound?
2007-03-22T14:45:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,crimsun gave me a command that put sound drivers back as it was.  and now i have sound.  the only bummer is that I have to reload ubuntu a few times to get sound. but i can live with it :P
2007-03-22T14:45:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,"yeah, a few times.  but sometimes im lucky and it works first boot"
2007-03-22T14:45:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,"well, that sucks, in my humble opinion.  you're wearing out your system just to get freakin' sound."
2007-03-22T14:45:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,"sometimes it works first boot, and others the 2nd or third boot"
2007-03-22T14:46:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,i have no choice :(   im not going to try to insyall anything again after 3 hours today :P
2007-03-22T14:46:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,i don't blame you.
2007-03-22T14:46:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,ill have to live with it
2007-03-22T14:46:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,"as i said, sometimes im lucky and it works first boot. eg, tonight i turned it on and sound worked first time :)"
2007-03-22T14:47:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,thanks a lot for today.  you were very patient and tried your best to help me.  i deeply appreciate it
2007-03-22T14:47:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy," thanks.  but I still feel like I totally burned you.  I still have an idea, but I think we're both a little burnt out on it."
2007-03-22T14:48:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy, is ALSA what you're using now?
2007-03-22T14:49:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,"well you didnt burn me as I said earlier, its your intent that counts.  you didnt purposely try to burn me. its was just an affect of good will."
2007-03-22T14:49:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,"the only thing different is when I right click on speaker icon and chose Preferences, it now has HDA intel Salsa mixer selceted"
2007-03-22T14:49:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,thanks for that.  really helps.  just curious.  is ALSA what's driving your sound?
2007-03-22T14:49:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,"after what we did, that wasnt available. and thats what causesd no sound I think"
2007-03-22T14:51:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,it says Salsa
2007-03-22T14:52:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,"when I right click on speaker icon and chose Preferences, it now has HDA intel Salsa mixer selceted"
2007-03-22T14:52:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,that wasnt there before
2007-03-22T14:52:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy, that's good.  at least it's using ALSA now.
2007-03-22T14:54:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy, I still think that adding a `options snd-hda-intel model=laptop` to `/etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base` may help though.  It'd be really easy to delete the line if it didn't work.
2007-03-22T14:55:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,what does options snd-hda-intel model=laptop do?
2007-03-22T14:55:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,we never tried that
2007-03-22T14:55:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,"tells your setup that you've got a laptop, basically."
2007-03-22T14:56:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,im too scared to change anything again :P
2007-03-22T14:56:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy, well.  it's a far easier fix (just delete the line) than having to re-install modules.  :)
2007-03-22T14:59:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,have you opened it FTP *and* SMTP?
2007-03-22T14:59:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,its ktorrent port
2007-03-22T15:00:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,i think its called UDP or something
2007-03-22T15:00:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy, there's an option especially for torrent programs in the drop down menu.
2007-03-22T15:00:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,what drop dwn menu?
2007-03-22T15:02:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,when you go to 'Add Rule' for Allow Service.
2007-03-22T15:03:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,in ktorrent?
2007-03-22T15:03:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy, your firewall is blocking ktorrent right?
2007-03-22T15:04:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,"no!  seems my router. because when I close firewall, it says its closed"
2007-03-22T15:04:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,"oh, sorry.  I misunderstood."
2007-03-22T15:04:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,I added to firewall anyway
2007-03-22T15:04:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,"so when firewall is closed, its still closed the port.  but I port forwared it on my router.  im confused"
2007-03-22T15:05:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,i've never worked with a router.  sorry i can't help you there.
2007-03-22T15:21:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,you a gang banger? :P
2007-03-22T15:23:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,wheee u from?
2007-03-22T15:26:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,I'm from the USA.
2007-03-22T15:45:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,be careful about naming ports in open forums.
2007-03-22T15:46:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,its not my proper port :)  i know
2007-03-22T15:47:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,u want it?
2007-03-22T15:47:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,I have the gparted live cd ISO
2007-03-22T15:48:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,"I have gparted live on disc.  i'm all good, over here."
2007-03-22T15:49:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,ok :)
2007-03-24T07:06:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,hello there :)
2007-03-24T07:07:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,"something weird happened.  now every single time I boot Ubuntu, sound works"
2007-03-24T07:07:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,"so mayne something you and I did, helped that to happen. :) so thanks :)"
2007-03-24T07:08:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy," it was probably just an initial install bug or something.  glad it's worked out for you.  ALSA wasn't even installed, so what we did ~may~ have helped."
2007-03-24T07:08:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,"it was annyoing havint to boot Ubuntu 2-3 times to get sound., but that doesnt happen anymore"
2007-03-24T07:08:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,plus you were wearing out your hardware doing that.  not cool.
2007-03-24T07:08:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,yeah. and wghats your prob today?
2007-03-24T07:08:00.000Z,eternaljoy,billy,"booting ubuntu wears out my hardware?  not much though, right?"
2007-03-24T07:09:00.000Z,billy,eternaljoy,"well, booting over and over again into wears it out faster, no matter what OS you're running."
