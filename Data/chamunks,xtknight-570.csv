2007-04-23T08:29:00.000Z,chamunks,,I understand it was just all i could do at the time
2007-04-23T08:30:00.000Z,chamunks,,i mean my lanparty nf4-ut expert mobo has raid aswell supported by the nf4 chip
2007-04-23T08:31:00.000Z,chamunks,,ok well i need to be able to tell ubuntu that these two drives arent seperate drives and are in a stripe
2007-04-23T08:31:00.000Z,chamunks,,not a mirror
2007-04-23T08:31:00.000Z,chamunks,,I would have liked to do it in the install phase but seeing as i was pinched for time its gonna have to be post install :S
2007-04-23T08:32:00.000Z,chamunks,,thats fine
2007-04-23T08:32:00.000Z,chamunks,,the rate of transfere boost that this will give will make things better
2007-04-23T08:32:00.000Z,chamunks,,Ok well im using 64 bit if that complicates things any
2007-04-23T08:33:00.000Z,chamunks,,Yep 250's
2007-04-23T08:33:00.000Z,chamunks,,beautiful!
2007-04-23T08:33:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,cool.  ok what are the block devices/
2007-04-23T08:26:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,i might be able to help.  i'm using a raid0 root right now
2007-04-23T08:27:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,i also have a /home raid0 ;)
2007-04-23T08:27:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,i love the performance so far
2007-04-23T08:28:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,"i'm using RAID0(md0): /, ext3, 80G; RAID0(md1): /home, xfs, 180G"
2007-04-23T08:28:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,ah so what does raid0 have to do with that?  i dont completely understand
2007-04-23T08:29:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,ah ok.  wait is this SW raid or HD raid?
2007-04-23T08:29:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,warning: i am insanely biased towards SW raid.
2007-04-23T08:29:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,"in a good way, that is.  SW raid is so much better"
2007-04-23T08:30:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,so what's your question?
2007-04-23T08:30:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,"nforce raid isnt supported in linux, to my knowledge.  slower than SW raid too"
2007-04-23T08:31:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,okay have you already installed and you would like to do this?  or do you want to do this during the install phase?
2007-04-23T08:32:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,"you dont care about ANY of the data on these partitions you want to stripe, right at the moment, correct?  it will be wiped when the array is created"
2007-04-23T08:32:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,well if it makes you feel better you can only do it during-install with the Alternate CD
2007-04-23T08:32:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,alright so you know the block devices of these two disks right?  250gb each disks?
2007-04-23T08:32:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,nope
2007-04-23T08:33:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,/dev/...
2007-04-23T08:33:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,please prefix your messages with my name so it highlights

2007-04-23T08:34:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,ok im in /dev in the file browser i kno i kno spoonfeeding :S but umm where would i look for this
2007-04-23T08:35:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,oh probably not that.  goto a terminal and type 'sudo fdisk -l'
2007-04-23T08:35:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,this is the first time attempting this in ubuntu so pls bear with :)
2007-04-23T08:35:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,ah okay
2007-04-23T08:35:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,yeah browsing the /dev folder isnt really common practice and it's not gonna help so close that one
2007-04-23T08:35:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,you know the terminal?
2007-04-23T08:35:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,oh yeah
2007-04-23T08:36:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,yeah im fairly well versed with everything else its just raid im totally noob at
2007-04-23T08:36:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,ill ask if it doesent make sense to me
2007-04-23T08:36:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,ok.  type 'sudo fdisk -l' in the terminal.  i need to know the block devices of the hard disks you want to stripe
2007-04-23T08:36:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,a block device is a filename that starts with /dev/  this is a HW address i need
2007-04-23T08:36:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,/dev/sdb1               1       30401   244196001   83  Linux
2007-04-23T08:37:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,and the other?
2007-04-23T08:37:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,"Disk /dev/sdc: 250.0 GB, 250059350016 bytes"
2007-04-23T08:37:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,okay so you're positive it's /dev/sdb and /dev/sdc
2007-04-23T08:37:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,cuz the data will be nuked from orbit ;P
2007-04-23T08:37:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,thats beautiful my friend will just have to not know that i restarted the whole transfere process lol :P

2007-04-23T08:38:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,'sudo umount /dev/sdb1' then 'sudo umount /dev/sdc1'
2007-04-23T08:39:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,its saying device busy for sudo umount /dev/sdb1
2007-04-23T08:39:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,how would i force unmount
2007-04-23T08:39:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,eh it usually doesnt work anyway.  close whatever is using sdb1

2007-04-23T08:55:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,press Ctrl C if you're still going thru the prompts
2007-04-23T08:55:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,yes this will be a temporary user.  remember whatever PW you use.  but press Ctrl C now because we made a mistake in the ocmmand.
2007-04-23T08:56:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,is Ctrl C not doing anything or sometihng
2007-04-23T08:56:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,ctrl c is unresponsive
2007-04-23T08:56:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,ok

2007-04-23T08:56:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,no just go thru the prompts
2007-04-23T08:57:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,risk of corruption is too great otherwise

2007-04-23T08:59:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,wait
2007-04-23T08:59:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,one sec

2007-04-23T09:00:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,yeah no kidding eh that would prolly be good to remember ;)

2007-04-23T09:13:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,ok now do the exact same for /dev/sdc1
2007-04-23T09:13:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,done
2007-04-23T09:14:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,press apply
2007-04-23T09:14:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,after applying do not close gparted yet
2007-04-23T09:14:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,k its still up
2007-04-23T09:14:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,"after the Apply is done, you should have two unformatted partitions.  right click on each and click Manage Flags.  enable RAID on both."
2007-04-23T09:15:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,"this step doesn't actually do anything, it's just for convenience."
2007-04-23T09:15:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,and apply those flags
2007-04-23T09:15:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,kay
2007-04-23T09:15:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,"now that that is done, exit gparted"
2007-04-23T09:15:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,where 2 next?
2007-04-23T09:16:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,'sudo mdadm --create --verbose /dev/md0 --level=0 --raid-devices=2 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1'
2007-04-23T09:17:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,"madm not found, should i apt-get it ??"
2007-04-23T09:17:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,yeah
2007-04-23T09:18:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,installing allready past proompts
2007-04-23T09:18:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,well let me know when mdadm--create ... succeeds
2007-04-23T09:19:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,succeeded
2007-04-23T09:19:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,sudo sh -c 'mdadm --detail --scan >> /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf'
2007-04-23T09:20:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,ok jsut brought me back to ~$
2007-04-23T09:21:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,when that completes please pastebin the contents of /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf
2007-04-23T09:21:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,nothing seems to have happened
2007-04-23T09:21:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,what do you mean
2007-04-23T09:22:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,i need the contents of /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf :O
2007-04-23T09:22:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,it's ok the command above wont do anything..wont appear to
2007-04-23T09:23:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,let's go we've almost got this
2007-04-23T09:23:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,pastebins not likin me today
2007-04-23T09:23:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,darn well post the last line of that file if you would
2007-04-23T09:23:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,paste the last line here
2007-04-23T09:24:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,is that a duplicate?
2007-04-23T09:24:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,gksu gedit /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf
2007-04-23T09:24:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,"remove the last, no duplicate"
2007-04-23T09:25:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,saved
2007-04-23T09:25:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,ok now run 'sudo update-initramfs -k `uname -r` -u'
2007-04-23T09:25:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,what was the name of your old home user account?  the original account on your PC?
2007-04-23T09:25:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,chamunks
2007-04-23T09:25:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,alright.  update initramfs done?
2007-04-23T09:26:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,yes
2007-04-23T09:26:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,now type 'blkid'.  find the one that corresponds to md0
2007-04-23T09:26:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,it should say something like this /dev/md0: UUID='6e4589e5-eee7-42fe-8291-22b86764cb8a' SEC_TYPE='ext2' TYPE='ext3'
2007-04-23T09:26:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,does it?
2007-04-23T09:27:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,oh wait it might not yet.  hold on.  we need to do sometihng else before that.
2007-04-23T09:27:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,yeah not yet
2007-04-23T09:27:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,btw you can't use gparted to manage this raid partition anymore
2007-04-23T09:27:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,im just a smidgen stressed sorry if i pull a few boob moments
2007-04-23T09:27:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks, 'sudo mkfs.ext3 /dev/md0'
2007-04-23T09:27:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,this will create an ext3 filesystem on the raid0 partition
2007-04-23T09:28:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,really? that kinda smells i like some gui's
2007-04-23T09:28:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,i dont think you're going to have to manage it ever anyway
2007-04-23T09:28:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,appears to be almost done
2007-04-23T09:29:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,ok /dev/md0 is your raid0 ext3 partition.  so now we have to make that /home again.  type 'gksu gedit /etc/fstab'
2007-04-23T09:29:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,just about there
2007-04-23T09:30:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,uncomment what i did before and edit it some right?
2007-04-23T09:30:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,leave what you did before.  dont touch that line
2007-04-23T09:30:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight, kay
2007-04-23T09:30:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,"insert an entry like this (spacing doesnt really matter, align it if you want but im kinda in a hurry): '/dev/md0   /home  ext3   defaults   0   0'"
2007-04-23T09:31:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,i dont really care that much i basicalyl just copied what u wrote if thats kewl
2007-04-23T09:32:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,save the file.  then type 'sudo mount -a' in the terminal.  alright it probably mounted fine.  let's copy over old files.  'sudo cp -av /home_backup/* /home/'
2007-04-23T09:33:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,it put everything in lost and found for some reason
2007-04-23T09:33:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,huh?
2007-04-23T09:34:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,/home/lost and found
2007-04-23T09:34:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,something like that jazz
2007-04-23T09:34:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,um that's weird
2007-04-23T09:34:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,well there is a lost+found directory.  that doesnt mean anything else created it.  it's supposed to be there you dont have to worry about that
2007-04-23T09:35:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,so have you typed the cp command?
2007-04-23T09:35:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,well it says the copy went through but it copied it all to lost+found
2007-04-23T09:35:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,weird
2007-04-23T09:35:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,sudo cp -av /home_backup/* /home/    exactly as you sent that
2007-04-23T09:35:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,type 'gksu nautilus'
2007-04-23T09:35:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,and just drag n drop it?
2007-04-23T09:36:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,well get it out of lost+found i guess
2007-04-23T09:36:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,ok nevermind i refreshed like a min later and its good
2007-04-23T09:36:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,okay so the structure should be like so: /home_backup/chamunks/HERE_ARE_MY_FILES
2007-04-23T09:37:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,er /home/chamunks/HERE_ARE_MY_FILES too
2007-04-23T09:37:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,yep so how would i re enable chamunks user or is that good as is?
2007-04-23T09:37:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,now go to the terminal again
2007-04-23T09:37:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight, ok
2007-04-23T09:37:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,let's make sure you own that folder.  'sudo chown -R chamunks:chamunks /home/chamunks'
2007-04-23T09:38:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,"after that you reboot, login as chamunks, and your /home will be on raid0.  copy his files to anywhere in your home folder and they will be on the raid0."
2007-04-23T09:38:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,"if all goes well, that is."
2007-04-23T09:38:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,ok nevermind it just copied it all /home/home/chamunks it is now
2007-04-23T09:38:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,huh?
2007-04-23T09:38:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,well it needs to be /home/chamunks/ to work properly.  move it accordingly
2007-04-23T09:38:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,thats the way it is now lol yep ok wil do ;)
2007-04-23T09:39:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,after that type the chown command.  then reboot.  if you have problems you have to use tempuser.  otherwise you should login as chamunkns
2007-04-23T09:39:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,and holy-crap-i-need-sleep so im' gonna have to take off right now.
2007-04-23T09:39:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,beautiful thanks your a life saver!!!
2007-04-23T09:39:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,night!
2007-04-23T09:40:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,"even if chamunks login doesnt work , /dev/md0 is your raid device, moutn it somehow if it's not mounted to /home or whatever, but you should be set..."
2007-04-23T09:40:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,k cya.
2007-04-28T09:40:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,thanks again for the raid help the other night that was a total life saver
2007-04-28T09:40:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,oh yeah i remember that...haha glad i covered your rear end ;)
2007-04-28T09:41:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,my palms were sweating i was so stressed over that lol
2007-04-28T09:41:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,that happens to me when i do anything :p
2007-04-28T09:42:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,heh no doubt
2007-04-28T09:46:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,nfs
2007-04-28T09:47:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,or smbfs .  check out fuse also for ftp and other virtual FSes
2007-04-28T09:47:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,how would i go by activating nfs
2007-04-28T09:47:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,what specifically are you trying to achieve?
2007-04-28T09:48:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,im trying to run this program called DeVeDe to convert my avi's to dvd player ready iso's and i want to do more than one dvd at a time so im using a second computer for this
2007-04-28T09:49:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,hrm still confused about how a network mount would help?
2007-04-28T09:49:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,i need a network mount that DeVeDe is going to see as a local folder so i can rip from a remote source to a remote destination (in my own lan of course)
2007-04-28T09:49:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,devede takes in a media file and outputs a DVD compatible file basically?
2007-04-28T09:50:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,yep it wraps it up rather nicely but this second rip box doesent have the hard drive space to do the conversion locally so im hoping to use the nfs mount as the destination aswell as the source
2007-04-28T09:50:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,ah i suppose you could do that
2007-04-28T09:51:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,"i dont relaly remember how to seutp nfs, and i dont have the ambition to walk you through SMB tonight :P"
2007-04-28T09:51:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,although i must say smb would be a good choice.  between linux and linux thouhg?
2007-04-28T09:51:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,I cant say it would be super speedy but it will work
2007-04-28T09:52:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,thanks anywho
2007-04-23T08:29:00.000Z,chamunks,,I understand it was just all i could do at the time
2007-04-23T08:30:00.000Z,chamunks,,i mean my lanparty nf4-ut expert mobo has raid aswell supported by the nf4 chip
2007-04-23T08:31:00.000Z,chamunks,,ok well i need to be able to tell ubuntu that these two drives arent seperate drives and are in a stripe
2007-04-23T08:31:00.000Z,chamunks,,not a mirror
2007-04-23T08:31:00.000Z,chamunks,,I would have liked to do it in the install phase but seeing as i was pinched for time its gonna have to be post install :S
2007-04-23T08:32:00.000Z,chamunks,,thats fine
2007-04-23T08:32:00.000Z,chamunks,,the rate of transfere boost that this will give will make things better
2007-04-23T08:32:00.000Z,chamunks,,Ok well im using 64 bit if that complicates things any
2007-04-23T08:33:00.000Z,chamunks,,Yep 250's
2007-04-23T08:33:00.000Z,chamunks,,beautiful!
2007-04-23T08:33:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,cool.  ok what are the block devices/
2007-04-23T08:26:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,i might be able to help.  i'm using a raid0 root right now
2007-04-23T08:27:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,i also have a /home raid0 ;)
2007-04-23T08:27:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,i love the performance so far
2007-04-23T08:28:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,"i'm using RAID0(md0): /, ext3, 80G; RAID0(md1): /home, xfs, 180G"
2007-04-23T08:28:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,ah so what does raid0 have to do with that?  i dont completely understand
2007-04-23T08:29:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,ah ok.  wait is this SW raid or HD raid?
2007-04-23T08:29:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,warning: i am insanely biased towards SW raid.
2007-04-23T08:29:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,"in a good way, that is.  SW raid is so much better"
2007-04-23T08:30:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,so what's your question?
2007-04-23T08:30:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,"nforce raid isnt supported in linux, to my knowledge.  slower than SW raid too"
2007-04-23T08:31:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,okay have you already installed and you would like to do this?  or do you want to do this during the install phase?
2007-04-23T08:32:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,"you dont care about ANY of the data on these partitions you want to stripe, right at the moment, correct?  it will be wiped when the array is created"
2007-04-23T08:32:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,well if it makes you feel better you can only do it during-install with the Alternate CD
2007-04-23T08:32:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,alright so you know the block devices of these two disks right?  250gb each disks?
2007-04-23T08:32:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,nope
2007-04-23T08:33:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,/dev/...
2007-04-23T08:33:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,please prefix your messages with my name so it highlights
2007-04-23T08:34:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,type xtk and press tab
2007-04-23T08:34:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,beautiful
2007-04-23T08:34:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,ok im in /dev in the file browser i kno i kno spoonfeeding :S but umm where would i look for this
2007-04-23T08:35:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,oh probably not that.  goto a terminal and type 'sudo fdisk -l'
2007-04-23T08:35:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,this is the first time attempting this in ubuntu so pls bear with :)
2007-04-23T08:35:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,ah okay
2007-04-23T08:35:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,yeah browsing the /dev folder isnt really common practice and it's not gonna help so close that one
2007-04-23T08:35:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,you know the terminal?
2007-04-23T08:35:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,oh yeah
2007-04-23T08:36:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,yeah im fairly well versed with everything else its just raid im totally noob at
2007-04-23T08:36:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,ill ask if it doesent make sense to me
2007-04-23T08:36:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,ok.  type 'sudo fdisk -l' in the terminal.  i need to know the block devices of the hard disks you want to stripe
2007-04-23T08:36:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,a block device is a filename that starts with /dev/  this is a HW address i need
2007-04-23T08:36:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,/dev/sdb1               1       30401   244196001   83  Linux
2007-04-23T08:37:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,and the other?
2007-04-23T08:37:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,"Disk /dev/sdc: 250.0 GB, 250059350016 bytes"
2007-04-23T08:37:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,okay so you're positive it's /dev/sdb and /dev/sdc
2007-04-23T08:37:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,cuz the data will be nuked from orbit ;P
2007-04-23T08:37:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,thats beautiful my friend will just have to not know that i restarted the whole transfere process lol :P
2007-04-23T08:38:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,ok unmount both now
2007-04-23T08:38:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,'sudo umount /dev/sdb1' then 'sudo umount /dev/sdc1'
2007-04-23T08:39:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,its saying device busy for sudo umount /dev/sdb1
2007-04-23T08:39:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,how would i force unmount
2007-04-23T08:39:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,eh it usually doesnt work anyway.  close whatever is using sdb1
2007-04-23T08:40:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,awwh friggin poop its /home/ :S

2007-04-23T08:55:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,yes this will be a temporary user.  remember whatever PW you use.  but press Ctrl C now because we made a mistake in the ocmmand.
2007-04-23T08:56:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,is Ctrl C not doing anything or sometihng
2007-04-23T08:56:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,ctrl c is unresponsive
2007-04-23T08:56:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,ok

2007-04-23T08:56:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,i could probably just close the terminal window
2007-04-23T08:56:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,no just go thru the prompts
2007-04-23T08:57:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,risk of corruption is too great otherwise

2007-04-23T09:25:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,ok now run 'sudo update-initramfs -k `uname -r` -u'
2007-04-23T09:25:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,what was the name of your old home user account?  the original account on your PC?
2007-04-23T09:25:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,chamunks
2007-04-23T09:25:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,alright.  update initramfs done?

2007-04-23T09:26:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,now type 'blkid'.  find the one that corresponds to md0
2007-04-23T09:26:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,it should say something like this /dev/md0: UUID='6e4589e5-eee7-42fe-8291-22b86764cb8a' SEC_TYPE='ext2' TYPE='ext3'
2007-04-23T09:26:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,does it?
2007-04-23T09:27:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,oh wait it might not yet.  hold on.  we need to do sometihng else before that.
2007-04-23T09:27:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,yeah not yet
2007-04-23T09:27:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,btw you can't use gparted to manage this raid partition anymore
2007-04-23T09:27:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,im just a smidgen stressed sorry if i pull a few boob moments
2007-04-23T09:27:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks, 'sudo mkfs.ext3 /dev/md0'
2007-04-23T09:27:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,this will create an ext3 filesystem on the raid0 partition
2007-04-23T09:28:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,really? that kinda smells i like some gui's
2007-04-23T09:28:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,i dont think you're going to have to manage it ever anyway
2007-04-23T09:28:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,appears to be almost done
2007-04-23T09:29:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,ok /dev/md0 is your raid0 ext3 partition.  so now we have to make that /home again.  type 'gksu gedit /etc/fstab'
2007-04-23T09:29:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,just about there
2007-04-23T09:30:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,uncomment what i did before and edit it some right?
2007-04-23T09:30:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,leave what you did before.  dont touch that line
2007-04-23T09:30:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight, kay
2007-04-23T09:30:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,"insert an entry like this (spacing doesnt really matter, align it if you want but im kinda in a hurry): '/dev/md0   /home  ext3   defaults   0   0'"
2007-04-23T09:31:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,i dont really care that much i basicalyl just copied what u wrote if thats kewl
2007-04-23T09:32:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,save the file.  then type 'sudo mount -a' in the terminal.  alright it probably mounted fine.  let's copy over old files.  'sudo cp -av /home_backup/* /home/'
2007-04-23T09:33:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,it put everything in lost and found for some reason
2007-04-23T09:33:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,huh?
2007-04-23T09:34:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,/home/lost and found
2007-04-23T09:34:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,something like that jazz
2007-04-23T09:34:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,um that's weird
2007-04-23T09:34:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,well there is a lost+found directory.  that doesnt mean anything else created it.  it's supposed to be there you dont have to worry about that
2007-04-23T09:35:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,so have you typed the cp command?
2007-04-23T09:35:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,well it says the copy went through but it copied it all to lost+found
2007-04-23T09:35:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,weird
2007-04-23T09:35:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,sudo cp -av /home_backup/* /home/    exactly as you sent that
2007-04-23T09:35:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,type 'gksu nautilus'
2007-04-23T09:35:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,and just drag n drop it?
2007-04-23T09:36:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,well get it out of lost+found i guess
2007-04-23T09:36:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,ok nevermind i refreshed like a min later and its good
2007-04-23T09:36:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,okay so the structure should be like so: /home_backup/chamunks/HERE_ARE_MY_FILES
2007-04-23T09:37:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,er /home/chamunks/HERE_ARE_MY_FILES too
2007-04-23T09:37:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,yep so how would i re enable chamunks user or is that good as is?
2007-04-23T09:37:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,now go to the terminal again
2007-04-23T09:37:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight, ok
2007-04-23T09:37:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,let's make sure you own that folder.  'sudo chown -R chamunks:chamunks /home/chamunks'
2007-04-23T09:38:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,"after that you reboot, login as chamunks, and your /home will be on raid0.  copy his files to anywhere in your home folder and they will be on the raid0."
2007-04-23T09:38:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,"if all goes well, that is."
2007-04-23T09:38:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,ok nevermind it just copied it all /home/home/chamunks it is now
2007-04-23T09:38:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,huh?
2007-04-23T09:38:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,well it needs to be /home/chamunks/ to work properly.  move it accordingly
2007-04-23T09:38:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,thats the way it is now lol yep ok wil do ;)
2007-04-23T09:39:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,after that type the chown command.  then reboot.  if you have problems you have to use tempuser.  otherwise you should login as chamunkns
2007-04-23T09:39:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,and holy-crap-i-need-sleep so im' gonna have to take off right now.
2007-04-23T09:39:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,beautiful thanks your a life saver!!!
2007-04-23T09:39:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,night!
2007-04-23T09:40:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,"even if chamunks login doesnt work , /dev/md0 is your raid device, moutn it somehow if it's not mounted to /home or whatever, but you should be set..."
2007-04-23T09:40:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,k cya.
2007-04-28T09:40:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,thanks again for the raid help the other night that was a total life saver
2007-04-28T09:40:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,oh yeah i remember that...haha glad i covered your rear end ;)
2007-04-28T09:41:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,my palms were sweating i was so stressed over that lol
2007-04-28T09:41:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,that happens to me when i do anything :p
2007-04-28T09:42:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,heh no doubt
2007-04-28T09:46:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,nfs
2007-04-28T09:47:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,or smbfs .  check out fuse also for ftp and other virtual FSes
2007-04-28T09:47:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,how would i go by activating nfs
2007-04-28T09:47:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,what specifically are you trying to achieve?
2007-04-28T09:48:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,im trying to run this program called DeVeDe to convert my avi's to dvd player ready iso's and i want to do more than one dvd at a time so im using a second computer for this
2007-04-28T09:49:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,hrm still confused about how a network mount would help?
2007-04-28T09:49:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,i need a network mount that DeVeDe is going to see as a local folder so i can rip from a remote source to a remote destination (in my own lan of course)
2007-04-28T09:49:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,devede takes in a media file and outputs a DVD compatible file basically?
2007-04-28T09:50:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,yep it wraps it up rather nicely but this second rip box doesent have the hard drive space to do the conversion locally so im hoping to use the nfs mount as the destination aswell as the source
2007-04-28T09:50:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,ah i suppose you could do that
2007-04-28T09:51:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,"i dont relaly remember how to seutp nfs, and i dont have the ambition to walk you through SMB tonight :P"
2007-04-28T09:51:00.000Z,xtknight,chamunks,although i must say smb would be a good choice.  between linux and linux thouhg?
2007-04-28T09:51:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,I cant say it would be super speedy but it will work
2007-04-28T09:52:00.000Z,chamunks,xtknight,thanks anywho
