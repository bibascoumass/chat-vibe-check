2005-05-25T16:15:00.000Z,nalioth,,howdy synd
2005-05-25T16:16:00.000Z,nalioth,,"i do speak german, some french, spanish and english (i drive a taxicab)"
2005-05-25T16:17:00.000Z,nalioth,,"Houston, Tx. driving a cab 3 years now"
2005-05-25T16:18:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,seedorf?
2005-05-25T16:18:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,what?
2005-05-25T16:19:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,"that's a base in germany, was wondering if you were stationed there :)"
2005-05-25T16:19:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,was stationed near Nurenburg
2005-05-31T07:33:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,so is xchat :)
2005-05-31T07:34:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,just showing that there are numerous options out there
2005-06-01T09:37:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,not quite
2005-06-01T09:38:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"you mean since i installed kubuntu-desktop, i'm not running ubuntu any more?"
2005-06-01T09:38:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,"ubuntu is the complete system, includeing gnome and gnome-centered tools"
2005-06-01T09:39:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"yes, and when you install kubuntu-desktop, its the same as if you went out and got KDEbase and other support debs.."
2005-06-01T09:39:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"it is still ubuntu, just with KDE"
2005-06-01T09:40:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"yes, i have multiple WMs"
2005-06-01T09:40:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,i know
2005-06-01T09:41:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,what is the diff? i was understanding that kubuntu was basically KDE on top of ubuntu
2005-06-01T09:42:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,"well, it isn't: as i said, if you install from a kubuntu cd you get lots of things a standard ubuntu install does not have. And you don't get lots of things a standard ubuntu install has. So it's not KDE on top of ubuntu, but a KDE-centered version of ubuntu"
2005-06-01T09:44:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,i was not aware there was a 'kubuntu install cd'
2005-06-01T09:45:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,"there is, see www.kubuntu.org"
2005-06-01T09:45:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,which is why i am of the thought that kubuntu is 'on top' of ubuntu (as it is on most everyone who installs from an ubuntu install cd)
2005-06-14T15:47:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,we have established that his english is just as bad :)
2005-06-14T15:48:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,ah
2005-06-16T08:21:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,it all depends on what you want the end result to be
2005-06-16T08:22:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,of course
2005-06-16T08:33:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,smartmontools
2005-06-18T13:04:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"not only to stay away from the RPM hell, either"
2005-06-18T13:06:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,very valuable lessons in how not to design a packaging system
2005-06-18T13:06:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,mandrake and redhat taught me a lot about linux
2005-06-18T13:07:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,a lot of 'use debian instead' lessons
2005-06-19T09:00:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,mkfs
2005-06-19T10:43:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"talks more than i do, lol"
2005-06-19T12:55:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"doesnt the ubuntu live or knoppix CDs have the fdisk capability, also?"
2005-06-20T14:23:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"VESA should enable scott_'s system to display 1280x1024, correct?"
2005-06-20T14:23:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,ENOCLUE
2005-06-25T09:35:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,there are exceptions to all rules
2005-06-25T13:29:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,completely back to windows mbr..?
2005-06-25T13:30:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"he wants NO mbr, so it loads ntldr instead"
2005-06-25T13:31:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,fdisk /mbr will make it use NTLDR again...
2005-06-25T13:31:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,we've been discussing all the ways for a few hours now
2005-06-25T13:31:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"he's kinda limited on his software (cds, floppys, etc)"
2005-06-25T13:32:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,know the command to follow 'dd' taht will clean his mbr?
2005-06-25T13:32:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,dd can restore the mbr if you have a good one
2005-06-25T13:34:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,no way to wipe a mbr from within knoppix/ubuntu?
2005-06-25T13:35:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,"you can wipe it with dd, but that won't restore it for windows..."
2005-06-25T13:35:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"in knoppix, would 'fdisk /dev/hd(#)/mbr work?"
2005-06-25T13:35:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,nope
2005-06-25T13:36:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,"i think he means access, spelling is difficult for some people ;)"
2005-06-25T15:55:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,kewl! can we get a play-by-play?
2005-06-25T15:56:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,"if it works, i'll publish it"
2005-06-25T15:57:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,we want to hear you scream when it doesnt.. .. ..:P
2005-06-25T15:57:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,lol :)
2005-06-27T11:56:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,bob2 how/where do you change the point where this looks? >>>checking build system type... powerpc-unknown-linux-gnu
2005-06-27T11:56:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,looks like part of the outpuf of ./configure
2005-06-27T11:57:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"yes it is, and i'm tired of being 'unknown powerpc'  what/where to i change the line so i become whatever"
2005-06-27T11:57:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,what's wrong with powerpc-unknown-linux-gnu..?
2005-06-27T12:56:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,not so much a case of early adoption but of sanity :)
2005-06-27T12:57:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,whats the diff tween the source at kernel.org and ubuntu kernel source?
2005-06-27T12:58:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,the debian/ubuntu patches and of course the nice deb buildsystem to create packages
2005-06-27T14:20:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,let them use woody to avoid dependency problems..
2005-06-27T14:21:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"woody, sarge, godzilla, 'traci lords', all these debian names i'm cluesless about"
2005-06-27T14:22:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,is there a 'make floppy image' thing in the ubuntu install cd?
2005-06-27T14:22:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,not yet
2005-06-27T14:27:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,is that a gtk-wget thang or gnome-wget?
2005-06-27T14:29:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,it uses gtk2 :)
2005-06-27T14:29:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,ok just wondering (i'll stick with my website pounding CLI wget)
2005-06-28T15:01:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"even with encryption, it should still be 'visible', right?"
2005-06-28T15:13:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"i'm confused about the java instructions, then"
2005-06-28T15:13:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,he downloaded a .deb created with these instructions
2005-06-28T15:13:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"i've been installing the java-blah.bin on everyones x86 ubuntu box i install, and no problems"
2005-06-28T15:13:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,do not do that!
2005-06-28T15:14:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,use make-jpkg
2005-06-28T15:14:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,now i'm really confused.
2005-06-28T15:15:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,the one and only true instructions for java are:
2005-06-28T15:15:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,"for java: download the .bin file from java.sun.com, apt-get install java-package, chmod +x [the .bin file] , make-jpkg [the bin file] , dpkg -i [the generated .deb file] "
2005-06-29T12:12:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,you missed pochos performance yesterday
2005-06-29T12:12:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,I heard about it
2005-06-29T12:13:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,were you around when it happened?
2005-06-29T12:14:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"yes, i was unfortunately here"
2005-06-29T12:28:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,hmm..? which one do you mean?
2005-06-29T12:29:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,there used to be a linke from the main wiki page to 'user documentation'. On the userdoc page i could 'find' words and see the link to the article
2005-06-29T12:29:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,i don't see teh userdoc page anymore
2005-06-29T12:29:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,UserDocumentation
2005-06-29T12:29:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"i'm there, but its not like it once was"

2005-06-29T12:30:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,well rats!
2005-06-29T12:30:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,the wiki has a search function :)
2005-06-29T12:30:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,i'm not impressed with the search function (i've used it)
2005-06-29T12:32:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,is there a list of all articles?
2005-06-29T12:32:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,there is AllPages afaik
2005-06-29T12:32:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,thx
2005-06-29T12:33:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,there is an 'allpages' but it doesnt do anything except invite you to build it
2005-06-30T08:05:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"no, you should not ANSWER yourself"
2005-06-30T08:10:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,you continue to amaze me
2005-06-30T08:10:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,hmm?

2005-06-30T08:12:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"well, i guess thats the best way to find something"
2005-06-30T08:30:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,"hmm, I don't think he meant that..."
2005-07-01T11:18:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,why did the forum idiots separate their stuff from the rest of the wiki/?
2005-07-01T11:18:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"i have no idea, i wasnt in on it"
2005-07-01T11:49:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,quit whining its 91f here
2005-07-01T11:50:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,"pfff, you must be melting :)"

2005-07-01T14:13:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,how many teraflops does the 12-Cell cluster you run on put out?
2005-07-01T14:14:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,"you must be mistaken, I do not run on a 12-Cell cluster but on an experimental FPGA / microthreaded alpha testbed"
2005-07-01T14:15:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,coulda sworn there was 12 of em involved
2005-07-01T14:17:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,afaik ther IS a way

2005-07-01T14:21:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,"ENOIDEA, it's just that the progeam says: 'WARNING: you should run this as root'"
2005-07-01T14:21:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,hmm i got a buttload of readable output re my system w/o sudo
2005-07-01T14:21:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,yeah /me too :)
2005-07-01T14:31:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,i did a very technical thing: i ran lshw both ways and there are only 4 lines different in output (according to 'diff')
2005-07-01T15:22:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,don't you need linux-restricted-modules and some xorg.conf tweaking on PPC?

2005-12-03T14:30:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,are you here?
2005-12-10T17:46:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"yes, i dont either, BUT i'd rather have a 'safe' one out there that is advertised by the ubuntu community than the unsafe shit that existed prior"
2005-12-10T17:47:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,"true, I'll have a look :)"
2005-12-19T12:16:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,Seveas offtopic
2006-01-02T06:34:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"yes it is, but if you MUST do it, at least minimize the damage (gksudo)"
2006-01-02T06:35:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,if you must use nautilus as root you're on the wrong path anyway and should rethink your steps :)
2006-01-02T06:35:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,i know. but some folks are convinced it's the only way
2006-01-02T09:44:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,has moved his files and not provided a forwarding URL

2006-04-15T12:34:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,"nothing, I pointed someone to your repo"
2006-04-15T12:35:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"i don't carry ppc java in my repos, tell them about !javadebs instead"
2006-04-15T12:35:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,"ah, I misubderstood that"
2006-04-26T16:59:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,too slow ;)

2006-08-09T15:45:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,prod --^
2006-09-25T10:43:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,that's way beyond the number of clones that freenode usually tolreates
2006-09-25T10:44:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,patience
2006-09-25T10:44:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,all klined

2008-02-01T18:56:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,-- he want to be on the k-line train
2005-05-25T16:14:00.000Z,nalioth,,howdy y'all
2005-05-25T16:15:00.000Z,nalioth,,howdy synd
2005-05-25T16:16:00.000Z,nalioth,,"i do speak german, some french, spanish and english (i drive a taxicab)"
2005-05-25T16:17:00.000Z,nalioth,,"Houston, Tx. driving a cab 3 years now"
2005-05-25T16:18:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,seedorf?
2005-05-25T16:18:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,what?
2005-05-25T16:19:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,"that's a base in germany, was wondering if you were stationed there :)"
2005-05-25T16:19:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,was stationed near Nurenburg
2005-05-31T07:33:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,so is xchat :)
2005-05-31T07:34:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,just showing that there are numerous options out there
2005-06-01T09:37:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,not quite
2005-06-01T09:38:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"you mean since i installed kubuntu-desktop, i'm not running ubuntu any more?"
2005-06-01T09:38:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,"ubuntu is the complete system, includeing gnome and gnome-centered tools"
2005-06-01T09:39:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"yes, and when you install kubuntu-desktop, its the same as if you went out and got KDEbase and other support debs.."
2005-06-01T09:39:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"it is still ubuntu, just with KDE"
2005-06-01T09:40:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"yes, i have multiple WMs"
2005-06-01T09:40:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,i know
2005-06-01T09:41:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,what is the diff? i was understanding that kubuntu was basically KDE on top of ubuntu
2005-06-01T09:42:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,"well, it isn't: as i said, if you install from a kubuntu cd you get lots of things a standard ubuntu install does not have. And you don't get lots of things a standard ubuntu install has. So it's not KDE on top of ubuntu, but a KDE-centered version of ubuntu"
2005-06-01T09:44:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,i was not aware there was a 'kubuntu install cd'
2005-06-01T09:45:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,"there is, see www.kubuntu.org"
2005-06-01T09:45:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,which is why i am of the thought that kubuntu is 'on top' of ubuntu (as it is on most everyone who installs from an ubuntu install cd)
2005-06-14T15:47:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,we have established that his english is just as bad :)
2005-06-14T15:48:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,ah
2005-06-16T08:21:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,it all depends on what you want the end result to be
2005-06-16T08:22:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,of course
2005-06-16T08:33:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,smartmontools
2005-06-18T13:04:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"not only to stay away from the RPM hell, either"
2005-06-18T13:06:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,very valuable lessons in how not to design a packaging system
2005-06-18T13:06:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,mandrake and redhat taught me a lot about linux
2005-06-18T13:07:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,a lot of 'use debian instead' lessons
2005-06-19T09:00:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,mkfs
2005-06-19T10:43:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"talks more than i do, lol"
2005-06-19T12:55:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"doesnt the ubuntu live or knoppix CDs have the fdisk capability, also?"
2005-06-20T14:23:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"VESA should enable scott_'s system to display 1280x1024, correct?"
2005-06-20T14:23:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,ENOCLUE
2005-06-25T09:35:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,there are exceptions to all rules
2005-06-25T13:29:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,completely back to windows mbr..?
2005-06-25T13:30:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"he wants NO mbr, so it loads ntldr instead"
2005-06-25T13:31:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,fdisk /mbr will make it use NTLDR again...
2005-06-25T13:31:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,we've been discussing all the ways for a few hours now
2005-06-25T13:31:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"he's kinda limited on his software (cds, floppys, etc)"
2005-06-25T13:32:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,know the command to follow 'dd' taht will clean his mbr?
2005-06-25T13:32:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,dd can restore the mbr if you have a good one
2005-06-25T13:34:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,no way to wipe a mbr from within knoppix/ubuntu?
2005-06-25T13:35:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,"you can wipe it with dd, but that won't restore it for windows..."
2005-06-25T13:35:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"in knoppix, would 'fdisk /dev/hd(#)/mbr work?"
2005-06-25T13:35:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,nope
2005-06-25T13:36:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,"i think he means access, spelling is difficult for some people ;)"
2005-06-25T15:55:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,kewl! can we get a play-by-play?
2005-06-25T15:56:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,"if it works, i'll publish it"
2005-06-25T15:57:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,we want to hear you scream when it doesnt.. .. ..:P
2005-06-25T15:57:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,lol :)
2005-06-27T11:56:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,bob2 how/where do you change the point where this looks? >>>checking build system type... powerpc-unknown-linux-gnu
2005-06-27T11:56:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,looks like part of the outpuf of ./configure
2005-06-27T11:57:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"yes it is, and i'm tired of being 'unknown powerpc'  what/where to i change the line so i become whatever"
2005-06-27T11:57:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,what's wrong with powerpc-unknown-linux-gnu..?
2005-06-27T12:56:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,not so much a case of early adoption but of sanity :)
2005-06-27T12:57:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,whats the diff tween the source at kernel.org and ubuntu kernel source?
2005-06-27T12:58:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,the debian/ubuntu patches and of course the nice deb buildsystem to create packages
2005-06-27T14:20:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,let them use woody to avoid dependency problems..
2005-06-27T14:21:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"woody, sarge, godzilla, 'traci lords', all these debian names i'm cluesless about"
2005-06-27T14:22:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,is there a 'make floppy image' thing in the ubuntu install cd?
2005-06-27T14:22:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,not yet
2005-06-27T14:27:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,is that a gtk-wget thang or gnome-wget?
2005-06-27T14:29:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,it uses gtk2 :)
2005-06-27T14:29:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,ok just wondering (i'll stick with my website pounding CLI wget)
2005-06-28T15:01:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"even with encryption, it should still be 'visible', right?"
2005-06-28T15:13:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"i'm confused about the java instructions, then"
2005-06-28T15:13:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,he downloaded a .deb created with these instructions
2005-06-28T15:13:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"i've been installing the java-blah.bin on everyones x86 ubuntu box i install, and no problems"
2005-06-28T15:13:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,do not do that!
2005-06-28T15:14:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,use make-jpkg
2005-06-28T15:14:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,now i'm really confused.
2005-06-28T15:15:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,the one and only true instructions for java are:
2005-06-28T15:15:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,"for java: download the .bin file from java.sun.com, apt-get install java-package, chmod +x [the .bin file] , make-jpkg [the bin file] , dpkg -i [the generated .deb file] "
2005-06-29T12:12:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,you missed pochos performance yesterday
2005-06-29T12:12:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,I heard about it
2005-06-29T12:13:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,were you around when it happened?
2005-06-29T12:14:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"yes, i was unfortunately here"
2005-06-29T12:28:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,hmm..? which one do you mean?
2005-06-29T12:29:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,there used to be a linke from the main wiki page to 'user documentation'. On the userdoc page i could 'find' words and see the link to the article
2005-06-29T12:29:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,i don't see teh userdoc page anymore
2005-06-29T12:29:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,UserDocumentation
2005-06-29T12:29:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"i'm there, but its not like it once was"

2005-06-29T12:30:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,well rats!
2005-06-29T12:30:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,the wiki has a search function :)
2005-06-29T12:30:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,i'm not impressed with the search function (i've used it)
2005-06-29T12:32:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,is there a list of all articles?
2005-06-29T12:32:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,there is AllPages afaik
2005-06-29T12:32:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,thx
2005-06-29T12:33:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,there is an 'allpages' but it doesnt do anything except invite you to build it
2005-06-30T08:05:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"no, you should not ANSWER yourself"
2005-06-30T08:10:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,you continue to amaze me
2005-06-30T08:10:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,hmm?
2005-06-30T08:12:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,how do you find all this stuff?
2005-06-30T08:12:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,i MADE that script :)
2005-06-30T08:12:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"well, i guess thats the best way to find something"
2005-06-30T08:30:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,"hmm, I don't think he meant that..."
2005-07-01T11:18:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,why did the forum idiots separate their stuff from the rest of the wiki/?
2005-07-01T11:18:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"i have no idea, i wasnt in on it"
2005-07-01T11:49:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,quit whining its 91f here
2005-07-01T11:50:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,"pfff, you must be melting :)"

2005-07-01T13:03:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,believe bchunk requires a bin and cue
2005-07-01T13:04:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,it's rather limited
2005-07-01T13:26:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,ouch...
2005-07-01T13:26:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,keep your dog away from it then ;)
2005-07-01T13:27:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"brb, and the dog rarely causes these things"
2005-07-01T14:13:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,how many teraflops does the 12-Cell cluster you run on put out?
2005-07-01T14:14:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,"you must be mistaken, I do not run on a 12-Cell cluster but on an experimental FPGA / microthreaded alpha testbed"
2005-07-01T14:15:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,coulda sworn there was 12 of em involved
2005-07-01T14:17:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,afaik ther IS a way
2005-07-01T14:19:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,you know everything
2005-07-01T14:20:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,"i just ran that w/o sudo, what's the diff?"
2005-07-01T14:21:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,"ENOIDEA, it's just that the progeam says: 'WARNING: you should run this as root'"
2005-07-01T14:21:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,hmm i got a buttload of readable output re my system w/o sudo
2005-07-01T14:21:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,yeah /me too :)
2005-07-01T14:31:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,i did a very technical thing: i ran lshw both ways and there are only 4 lines different in output (according to 'diff')
2005-07-01T15:22:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,don't you need linux-restricted-modules and some xorg.conf tweaking on PPC?
2005-07-01T15:22:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,mine ran out of the box
2005-07-02T05:16:00.000Z,Seveas,nalioth,"I'm shutting down thw 12-cell cluster, cya tommorow :)"

2005-07-03T16:24:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,did the bulb just light up?
2005-07-03T16:27:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,has someone been playing with your tanks EM shield?
2005-07-03T16:28:00.000Z,nalioth,Seveas,can xryy 'touch' a  new one?
