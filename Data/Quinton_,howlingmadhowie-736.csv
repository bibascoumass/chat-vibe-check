2007-07-26T16:09:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"what tells you to enter a command? does some sort of graphical interface start, or does it look like an old dos window?"
2007-07-26T16:10:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,please don't use <enter> for punctuation :)
2007-07-26T16:12:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"then you are now on the command line. what sort of graphics card do you have, and what command did it suggest exactly?"
2007-07-26T16:12:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,fixable?
2007-07-26T16:13:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,don't know yet. probably. if you saw a windowing environment when you installed (i.e. you installed from a standard live cd) then it most definately is fixable
2007-07-26T16:13:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,installed from text mode
2007-07-26T16:14:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,so what's your graphics card? 'lspci | grep VGA'

2007-07-26T16:17:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"i'd suggest changing the video driver back to something very simple. like 'vesa'. can you manage that yourself, or should i tell you how to do that?"
2007-07-26T16:18:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,please tell

2007-07-26T16:30:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,enter 'which sudo'. does it say something or does the prompt come straight back?
2007-07-26T16:31:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,now it says root@ubuntu:~# so what do i type now?
2007-07-26T16:31:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,they didnt work... i dont know what im doing wrong.... what exactly do i type after that?
2007-07-26T16:32:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"after you have root access (which you now have), type 'cd /etc/X11'"

2007-07-26T16:35:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"cd = change directory, cp = copy"
2007-07-26T16:35:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,ok now what?
2007-07-26T16:36:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"type 'ls'. do you see an xorg.conf? do you see any other files starting with xorg.conf (for example xorg.conf.backup)? if so, what are they called?"
2007-07-26T16:36:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,xorg.conf and xorg.conf.old
2007-07-26T16:37:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"okay. try the following: 'cat xorg.conf | grep Device'. do you see the word 'nvidia', 'nv', or 'vesa'? if so, which one?"
2007-07-26T16:38:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,it just loaded the same roo ubuntu etc x11 thingy and shown nothing
2007-07-26T16:39:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"hang on. if you enter 'cat xorg.conf', do you get a lot of text whizzing by?"
2007-07-26T16:40:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,yeah....
2007-07-26T16:40:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"okay, we're going to open a text editor and edit xorg.conf. enter the following: 'nano -w xorg.conf'"
2007-07-26T16:41:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,now?
2007-07-26T16:42:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,use the arrow keys to scroll down the text until you find the Section 'Device'
2007-07-26T16:43:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,inputdevice?
2007-07-26T16:43:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,oh nvm... found it
2007-07-26T16:43:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,what's the name of the Driver?
2007-07-26T16:43:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,nv
2007-07-26T16:44:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,okay. change the driver to 'vesa'
2007-07-26T16:44:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,just backspace and type it in?
2007-07-26T16:44:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,exactly
2007-07-26T16:44:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,ok... now what?
2007-07-26T16:45:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"type Ctrl+O to save, and Ctrl+X to quit"
2007-07-26T16:45:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,is that zero or a o ?
2007-07-26T16:45:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,that's an 'o' like oscar :)
2007-07-26T16:46:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,ok all saved and i ctrl-x now what?
2007-07-26T16:46:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,oh yeah it wrote 159 lines
2007-07-26T16:46:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,type '/etc/init.d/?dm restart'
2007-07-26T16:47:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,works so far
2007-07-26T16:47:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,=D wow
2007-07-26T16:48:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"you should get some sort of windowing environment. the resolution is probably awful, but it's a start. the next job is to install the correct driver (vesa is just there to help you out in an emergency)"
2007-07-26T16:48:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,how do i turn on all the cool windows effects?
2007-07-26T16:50:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"until you've installed the correct driver, the 3d effects won't work. as i don't have a modern nvidia card, i don't know which driver you should install now. try searching ubuntuforums.org. something else you can try is System->Administration->'management of limited drivers' (or whatever it's called in your system language (I'm using german myself, so that's just a rough translation))"
2007-07-26T16:50:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,why is it have horrible speed issues on 2000ddr memory?
2007-07-26T16:51:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"if the windowing environment is slow, it's because you're using the vesa driver. it's just there to help out in an emergency. these issues will be resolved when you instlal the correct driver"
2007-07-26T16:51:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,from the nvidia website?
2007-07-26T16:52:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,i'd be surprised if you have to go to the bother to go to the nvidia website. i'd imagine you can install them using synaptic packet manager
2007-07-26T16:53:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,i have a sony vaio vgn-ar520e model.... errr any idea what my driver is and if synaptic will have it?
2007-07-26T16:56:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,i imagine that will be the newest nvidia driver
2007-07-26T16:56:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,is that driver compatible?
2007-07-26T16:56:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,im on 6.10 ghusty....
2007-07-26T16:56:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,someone told me too... ><;
2007-07-26T16:57:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"6.10 edgy eft, or 7.10 gutsy gibbon?"
2007-07-26T16:57:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,edgy thats is
2007-07-26T16:57:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,whats the difference in all of them?
2007-07-26T16:58:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"i'd try opening 'System->Administration->Synaptic package manager', search for 'nvidia' and then select 'nvidia-glx'. click on install"
2007-07-26T16:58:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"well, the first two numbers tell you the date the distribution was launched (6.10 is october 2006)"
2007-07-26T16:59:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,it asked for acd so im letting it load =] 
2007-07-26T05:00:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"i'd really install 7.04 in your case. there's no point using older software. if you have a fast internet connection, you can update 6.10 to 7.04 without needing to reinstall. what's acd?"
2007-07-26T05:00:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"oh, a cd :)"
2007-07-26T05:00:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,and this will install the driver and add a better visual to the screen also make the screen resolution fit?
2007-07-26T05:00:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"if this works, this will mean you are using the official nvidia display driver"
2007-07-26T05:01:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,you may have to set the resolution yourself (i'm not sure how good the driver is at guessing the right resolution to use)
2007-07-26T05:01:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,i did the restart like it asked
2007-07-26T05:02:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,and did it work?
2007-07-26T05:02:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,i dunno its booting =p
2007-07-26T05:02:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,yeah it shows picture still...
2007-07-26T05:03:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,that's a good sign. let's see if 3d acceleration is working. what happens if you do the following: Alt+F2: 'glxgears' <enter>
2007-07-26T05:03:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,soooo how do i go about adding them cool effects to burn the screen away when closed and make them wobble and alternate and stuff all cool?
2007-07-26T05:05:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,i'd recommend updating to 7.04 before you do anything else. did you try the command i gave you?
2007-07-26T05:05:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,hm? what command? im installing updates =D
2007-07-26T05:18:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,my wireless internet i havent tried yet.... photoshop.... and the upgrade wont work
2007-07-26T05:06:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,Alt+F2: 'glxgears' <enter>
2007-07-26T05:06:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,its just doing nothing?
2007-07-26T05:08:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,that's not a good sign. try: Alt+F2 'nvidia-settings' <enter>
2007-07-26T05:08:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,loaded
2007-07-26T05:10:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,i think i'd really recommend updating to 7.04. (so either installing new or using the system update option in the update manager)
2007-07-26T05:10:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,i am right after the updates.... whys it so important to upgrade?
2007-07-26T05:11:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,because 7.04 is better than 6.10 :)
2007-07-26T05:11:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,alrighty
2007-07-26T05:11:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,and there's no reason not to
2007-07-26T05:11:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,will i have the cool screen effects?
2007-07-26T05:12:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"but updating will probably take about an hour. you should be able to activate the cube and wobbly-windows straight away. i've only got a really old graphics card myself, so i don't use them (i also find some software which i use doesn't like the cube effects)"
2007-07-26T05:13:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,i love the cube and wobbly windows.... then i want it to where when i close a windows it like glows from bottom to top... like its glowing it away and when a windows minimized or maximized it like squished up and stufff
2007-07-26T05:18:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,there are only 3 more problems
2007-07-26T05:20:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"wireless: depends on what wireless card you have. support is a lot better in 7.04 than in 6.10. photoshop: there isn't a linux version of this. you can try to use the windows version in an emulator or install windows in a virtual machine inside linux, or use the gimp (which is about as powerful, but the GUI is very different). if the upgrade isn't working, i'd suggest downloading the 7.04 cd and installing new"
2007-07-26T05:21:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,upgrades working now...
2007-07-26T05:22:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,theres a linux version of photoshop?
2007-07-26T05:22:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,not in this century there isn't.
2007-07-26T05:22:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,so im guessing i would use wine.... ?
2007-07-26T05:23:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"you can try wine, it may work. installing it inside a windows virtual machine is the sure fire answer. that will always work. however, i'd recommend having a look at the gimp at some stage. it is extremely powerful (it is used for example to touch up the special effects for the harry potter films amongst others)"
2007-07-26T05:24:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,I am not very fond of the gimp and dont really like it
2007-07-26T05:24:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,then you're going to have to jump through some hoops to get photoshop installed.
2007-07-26T05:25:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,i see.... may i go take a quike shower? its morning here....
2007-07-26T05:27:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,i hearby confer upon Quinton the right to partake in one (1) shower without let or hindrance :)
2007-07-26T05:42:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,and i also wouldn't encourage sony by buying their products :(
2007-07-26T05:33:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,"lmao i read your message, funny. SO the update is almost done"
2007-07-26T05:34:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"after it's updated, you'll have to restart the computer"
2007-07-26T05:34:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,of course
2007-07-26T05:35:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,so after this all i need is to make adobe dreamweaver... photoshop... and pidgin with wireless work... then im set
2007-07-26T05:40:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"dreamweaver is also windows/mac only. a virtual machine looks increasingly to be your best bet here. if you really want to use dreamweaver and photoshop, you should know that adobe doesn't support linux. there is native linux software which is as capable, but you'd have to learn to do things new. in your case, i'd recommend dual-booting and trying out the linux versions, while retaining the windows versions in a wi"
2007-07-26T05:41:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,i would love to dual boot but sony vaio STRICTLY has the harddrive like pined down to not let anyone install xp... only vista
2007-07-26T05:41:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,thus why i got linux
2007-07-26T05:42:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"then your next step will be installing windows xp in a virtual machine inside linux. i've never done that myself, so i can't help much. i'd recommend looking into qemu and kvm"
2007-07-26T05:43:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,the only thing with 2000ddr for 1200$ rather than like 2500$
2007-07-26T05:44:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,17' also
2007-07-26T05:45:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,so howd you learn this much about linux?

2007-07-26T05:47:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,I've been using linux for about 3 years now. and i'm very interested in computers. there are however hundreds of thousands of people who know a lot more than i do
2007-07-26T05:48:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,it shouldn't be impossible. first install windows in a virtual machine (check out qemu and kvm). then install photoshop in windows

2007-07-26T06:03:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,"alright, it still boots good! a little slower though"
2007-07-26T06:04:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,=[ it says desktop effects cannot be enabled =[
2007-07-26T06:05:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,sounds like the right nvidia driver hasn't been installed. go to 'System->Administration->Manage Restricted Drivers' (or whatever it's called in english)
2007-07-26T06:06:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,gotta install the package?
2007-07-26T06:06:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,sounds good
2007-07-26T06:06:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,no i mean to get into it
2007-07-26T06:07:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"due to licensing restrictions, some drivers can not be installed automatically"
2007-07-26T06:07:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,i see
2007-07-26T06:09:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,wireless doesnt work
2007-07-26T06:09:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,how about the nvidia driver? did that install okay?
2007-07-26T06:10:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,it says my hardware doesnt need any restricted drivers
2007-07-26T06:10:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,strange. the nvidia 8400 most definitely needs restricted drivers
2007-07-26T06:11:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,no clue here...
2007-07-26T06:14:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,according to http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux_display_ia32_100.14.09.html the 8400M GT is supported in the current nvidia driver. it may well be in 'System->Administration->Synaptic Package Manager'
2007-07-26T06:15:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,i found restricted drivers
2007-07-26T06:16:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,lucent/agere linmodem controller driver?
2007-07-26T06:17:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,for your internal modem.
2007-07-26T06:17:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,like my wireless?
2007-07-26T06:18:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"nope. just the modem. getting the wireless to work could be tricky, depending on what chipset sony decided to use"
2007-07-26T06:19:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,I have no idea what chipset they used
2007-07-26T06:19:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,have you found the current nvidia driver in Synaptic Package Manager?
2007-07-26T06:19:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,oh download it from synaptic?
2007-07-26T06:20:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,has lots of restricted things under nvidia
2007-07-26T06:21:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,so d/l nvidia glx new ?
2007-07-26T06:21:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,yep :)
2007-07-26T06:23:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,changes applies...
2007-07-26T06:24:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,sounds good. now you can restart the windowing system ('Ctrl+Alt+Backspace')
2007-07-26T06:25:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,MUCH faster
2007-07-26T06:26:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,thats so fast....
2007-07-26T06:26:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"good. that's probably a good sign. just to make sure, can you do the following: Alt+F2, 'glxgears' <enter>"
2007-07-26T06:26:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,are compiz and beryl ubuntu screen effects?
2007-07-26T06:27:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,it did not do anything
2007-07-26T06:27:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"yeah. the situation with beryl and compiz is quite complicated at the moment. beryl was a fork of the compiz project, now they're getting back together again in something called 'compizfusion' if i recall correctly"
2007-07-26T06:28:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,then maybe you don't have the test program installed. try searching for glxgears in the Synaptic Package Manager and installing it. then repeat Alt+F2 'glxgears' <enter>
2007-07-26T06:29:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,mesa-utils ?
2007-07-26T06:29:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,sounds good
2007-07-26T06:30:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,nope still doesnt do anything
2007-07-26T06:32:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,as shown from videos on youtube compiz fusion work nice...
2007-07-26T06:33:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,then let's get more information. go to 'Applications->Accessories->Terminal'. wait till a terminal appears then enter 'glxgears'.
2007-07-26T06:34:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,"it says 'GLX' missing on display ':0.0'. Error couldnt get an RGB, double-buffered visual"
2007-07-26T06:35:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"i have the feeling this could all go very wrong. one of your main motivations for using ubuntu seems to be the eye candy. i can understand that, but if we can't get photophop and dreamweaver installed in a windows virtual machine, then it doesn't matter how good the eye-candy is"
2007-07-26T06:35:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,that's not a good sign. can you try rebooting the computer?
2007-07-26T06:35:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,of course
2007-07-26T06:36:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,works very quikly... and is now booting back up...
2007-07-26T06:36:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,no.. I never have... even on the preinstalled vista
2007-07-26T06:37:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"as far as i know, before the windowing sysem starts, a big nvidia splash screen appears if you're using the nvida driver"
2007-07-26T06:38:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"as far as i can tell, this means that the nvidia driver still isn't being used. try running 'nvidia-settings'"
2007-07-26T06:38:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,never has...
2007-07-26T06:38:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,works... now what ?
2007-07-26T06:39:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,set the screen resolution you want (in X server display configuration) and then  'Save to X Configuation File'
2007-07-26T06:40:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,thats not there...
2007-07-26T06:41:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,did you manage to start the nvidia-settings program?
2007-07-26T06:42:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,it did
2007-07-26T06:42:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,and you can see a nice grafical software where you can configure your graphics card?
2007-07-26T06:43:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,it just says... enable tooltips.... display status bar. slider text entires. show 'really quit' dialog and unchecked is include c display names in config file
2007-07-26T06:44:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,that sounds like the last page in the software. is there a menu on the left in the window? (X server information... x server display configuration...)
2007-07-26T06:45:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,nvidia-settings configuration: and thats all it says
2007-07-26T06:46:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,and nvidia-settings is installed?
2007-07-26T06:46:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,yeah and when i type a little box pops up
2007-07-26T06:49:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,one second
2007-07-26T06:49:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,ok
2007-07-26T06:54:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"when i enter nvidia-settings, this program is started: http://img228.imageshack.us/img228/2949/bildschirmfotoij2.png"
2007-07-26T06:55:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,not me
2007-07-26T06:57:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"strange. okay. let's do this the direct way. open a terminal, 'sudo -i' 'cd /etc/X11' 'nano -w xorg.conf'"
2007-07-26T06:58:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,got it
2007-07-26T06:58:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"oh, hang on. i've found something interesting. just try in a terminal: 'sudo nvidia-xconfig'"
2007-07-26T07:00:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,doesnt give any options just says 3 lines about using x configuration
2007-07-26T07:00:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,perfect. now restart the windowing system ('Ctrl+Alt+Backspace')
2007-07-26T07:01:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,its just.... black
2007-07-26T07:01:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,nothing?
2007-07-26T07:01:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,nope
2007-07-26T07:01:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,i'm starting to get annoyed with this nvidia driver
2007-07-26T07:01:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,sorry
2007-07-26T07:02:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,ctrl+alt+f2 didnt do anything
2007-07-26T07:03:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,oh
2007-07-26T07:03:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,left alt doesnt work
2007-07-26T07:04:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"okay, restart the computer :("
2007-07-26T07:05:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,it will work .... i think....
2007-07-26T07:05:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,nope... now were back where we began...
2007-07-26T07:05:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,blackscreen after it boots
2007-07-26T07:06:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,and does Ctrl+Alt+F2 do anything?
2007-07-26T07:06:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,no... and this is a laptop
2007-07-26T07:07:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,okay. things have gone pear-shaped. Ctrl-Alt-Backspace doesn't do anything either?
2007-07-26T07:07:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,no
2007-07-26T07:09:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,what to do?
2007-07-26T07:09:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"oh boy. i think the easy way out is to install ubuntu again. looks like the nvidia driver has claimed another victim. if you still think my advice is any good, download the new version (7.04) and install from that disk"
2007-07-26T07:09:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,i cant
2007-07-26T07:10:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,i HAVE to text base install or tty cannot be accesed and job control is turned off...
2007-07-26T07:11:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,plus it wont recognize nvidia just like this time... besides that im already on ver 7.04
2007-07-26T07:11:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,then the alternative install cd for 7.04?
2007-07-26T07:13:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,what do I do?
2007-07-26T07:13:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"hang on, i think we can rescue it."
2007-07-26T07:14:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"restart, and press escape when it tells you to"
2007-07-26T07:14:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,recoverymode?
2007-07-26T07:15:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,nope. change the options for standard boot mode by deleting 'splash' and 'quiet' and adding 'runlevel=3'
2007-07-26T07:16:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,i hit esc... so now what?
2007-07-26T07:16:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,press e
2007-07-26T07:17:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,press e again
2007-07-26T07:17:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,now... ?
2007-07-26T07:18:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,deleted 'quiet' and 'splash' and add 'runlevel=3'
2007-07-26T07:18:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,"i got grub edit> root (hd0,0)"
2007-07-26T07:19:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"oh, sorry. press escape"
2007-07-26T07:19:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,ok now?
2007-07-26T07:19:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,and press escape again until you get up to the top menu
2007-07-26T07:19:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,let's try recovery mode :)
2007-07-26T07:20:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,loading it...
2007-07-26T07:20:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,lots of text should go flying by
2007-07-26T07:21:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,it stoppped and sayysss root@ubuntu:~# select () to /dev/rtc to wait for clock tick timed out
2007-07-26T07:21:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,good. enter 'cd /etc/X11'
2007-07-26T07:22:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,does it complain at all?
2007-07-26T07:22:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,no
2007-07-26T07:22:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,good. let's check to see it did that. enter 'pwd'. do you see /etc/X11 ?
2007-07-26T07:23:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,yeah
2007-07-26T07:23:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,good :) now enter the following 'mv xorg.conf.backup xorg.conf'
2007-07-26T07:23:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,didnt do anything
2007-07-26T07:24:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,maybe it did :) 'ls -lh' what's the date of xorg.conf?
2007-07-26T07:25:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,08:59
2007-07-26T07:25:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"mm, hang on. when you enter 'ls' what files to you see which start with 'xorg.conf'?"
2007-07-26T07:26:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,conf and conf old
2007-07-26T07:27:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,sounds good. 'reboot'
2007-07-26T07:27:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,how?
2007-07-26T07:27:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,enter the word 'reboot'
2007-07-26T07:28:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"if the computer doesn't boot again to where we were before we started playing around with the nvidia driver, we'll have to boot again in recovery mode and edit xorg.conf by hand using a text editor (nano)"
2007-07-26T07:28:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,booted
2007-07-26T07:28:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,have you got the windowing environment running? (X server)
2007-07-26T07:29:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,i guess.... ?
2007-07-26T07:29:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,so you can log in normally ?
2007-07-26T07:29:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,yeah
2007-07-26T07:29:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,cool :)
2007-07-26T07:30:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,now then. what do you see under 'System->Administration->Restricted Drivers Manager'?
2007-07-26T07:31:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,the modem thing still
2007-07-26T07:31:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,and still no reference to a graphics card?
2007-07-26T07:32:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,no
2007-07-26T07:32:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,can you open a terminal and type the following: 'lspci | grep VGA'
2007-07-26T07:33:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,says VGA compatible controle nvidia coorp unkown device 0426 (rev a 1)
2007-07-26T07:34:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,it really shouldn't be an unknown device by now. i wonder what's up with the driver. did you get the driver from the cd or from the internet?
2007-07-26T07:35:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,cd...
2007-07-26T07:35:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,a-ha! that could be what's going wrong. the version on the cd is really old.
2007-07-26T07:36:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,start the Synaptic Package Manager and go to Settings->sources
2007-07-26T07:37:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,there is no sources?
2007-07-26T07:38:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,whatever it's called in the language you're using. maybe it's 'package sources' or something similar (under Settings in the navigation for the Synaptic Package Management window)
2007-07-26T07:38:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,"preferences, respriotires, filters, set internal option, toolbar"
2007-07-26T07:39:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,repositories :)
2007-07-26T07:39:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,now?
2007-07-26T07:40:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"activate 'main', 'universe', 'restricted' and 'multiverse'. on one of the tabs of that window there could be a way to switch off the cd as a software source. if you can, do this."
2007-07-26T07:41:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,how do i turn off the cd?
2007-07-26T07:42:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,hang on. my laptop is in english. i'll just boot it and see how to do that
2007-07-26T07:43:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,ok i removed cd option and turned o nwhat you said now what?
2007-07-26T07:44:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,shut the repositories dialog screen and click 'Reload' on the main Synaptic Package Management screen
2007-07-26T07:45:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,shut Synaptic Package Manager and start 'System->Administration->Update Manager'
2007-07-26T07:46:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,nothing
2007-07-26T07:47:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,click 'Check'
2007-07-26T07:47:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,nothing
2007-07-26T07:48:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,then it must have got the new nvidia version from the net. which of course doesn't answer the question as to why it doesn't appear in the restricted drivers list
2007-07-26T07:50:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,okay. the next approach would be to download the nvidia driver directly from nvidia.com and install it.
2007-07-26T07:51:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,find the driver for me? =[ I think I will mess up
2007-07-26T07:55:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,have a look at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=441658&highlight=8400m and https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NvidiaManual
2007-07-26T07:55:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"if you have any problems, let me know. i should really be getting to do some work now"
2007-07-26T08:03:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,i tired the instructions and it says i cannot find the file i downloaded after following nvidias strict instructions
2007-07-26T08:05:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,where did you download the file to? can you see it on your desktop?
2007-07-26T08:05:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,yes
2007-07-26T08:06:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,good. then open a terminal and enter 'cd Desktop'. you should now be able to see the driver (enter 'ls')
2007-07-26T08:07:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,no such file or drectory
2007-07-26T08:07:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,what does 'pwd' say?
2007-07-26T08:08:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,/home/quinton
2007-07-26T08:08:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,'cd Desktop'
2007-07-26T08:09:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,no such file or drectory
2007-07-26T08:10:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,'ls' what do you see?
2007-07-26T08:10:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,desktop examples sudo
2007-07-26T08:15:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"sorry, my boss just called :) so, where were we? 'ls' replies that there is a file called 'desktop' (which surprises me because it is usually called 'Desktop') and when you enter 'cd Desktop' it replies 'no such file or directory'."
2007-07-26T08:16:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,i just need step by step for beryl and nvidia?
2007-07-26T08:17:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,i can do everything else on my own
2007-07-26T08:17:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,and you're sure you entered 'cd Desktop' and not 'cd desktop'?
2007-07-26T08:18:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,oh... ok so whats next lol ?
2007-07-26T08:19:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,i'd move the driver to the /root directory.
2007-07-26T08:19:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,wheres that?
2007-07-26T08:20:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,enter 'sudo -i' and your password. then 'mv /home/quinton/Desktop/NVIDIA* $HOME'
2007-07-26T08:21:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,just put a >
2007-07-26T08:23:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,sounds good. enter 'cd $HOME'
2007-07-26T08:23:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,just loaded root@ubuntu again
2007-07-26T08:25:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,and what do 'pwd' and 'ls' now say?
2007-07-26T08:26:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,/root and root@ubuntu:~#
2007-07-26T08:27:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"there's nothing in the directory? strange. 'ls /home/quinton/Desktop'. is the driver you downloaded from the nvidia website still there? if yes, can you write the first 5 letters?"
2007-07-26T08:28:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,write the first 5 letters?
2007-07-26T08:29:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,just tell me the first 5 letters
2007-07-26T08:30:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,NVIDI ?
2007-07-26T08:31:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,okay. now on the console (assuming you still have a root prompt) enter 'mv /home/quinton/Desktop/NVIDI* $HOME'
2007-07-26T08:32:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,no destination
2007-07-26T08:34:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"okay, you're typing something wrongly. try this 'mv /home/quinton/Desktop/NVIDI* /root'"
2007-07-26T08:34:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,says root@ubuntu etc...
2007-07-26T08:35:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,now what?
2007-07-26T08:36:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,okay: 'cd' and 'ls'. you should see the NVIDIA driver
2007-07-26T08:36:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,yes
2007-07-26T08:39:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,now?
2007-07-26T08:40:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"cool. now you can carry on with the instructions on the nvidia site ( or on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NvidiaManual ). just remember to 'sudo -i' to get to a root window, and then 'cd /root' to get to the directory with the driver in it before running 'sh ./NVIDIA*' again, otherwise you won't find it"
2007-07-26T08:42:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,it say to turn off x server before install ?
2007-07-26T08:44:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"to do that, enter 'Ctrl+Alt+F2'. log in. 'sudo -i', enter password. '/etc/init.d/gdm stop'"
2007-07-26T08:45:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,then how do i get back to the nvidia installer?
2007-07-26T08:46:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,now enter 'sh ./NVIDIA*'
2007-07-26T08:46:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,and follow the on screen instructions
2007-07-26T08:47:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,wtf... no matching precompiled kernel interface was found on NVIDIA
2007-07-26T08:47:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,it cant find a precompiled kernel
2007-07-26T08:48:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,ERROR: you do not appear to have libc header files installed on your system. Please install your distibution's libc development package ?
2007-07-26T08:49:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,okay. you'll need that. quit the installation and follow the instructions on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NvidiaManual
2007-07-26T08:50:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,you can return to the X server by entering ctrl+alt+f7
2007-07-26T08:54:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,upon installing the essentials it says it couldnt find the package
2007-07-26T08:56:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,i'm wondering if i can dial in from outside and do this for you. it's starting to take way to long
2007-07-26T08:57:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,please?
2007-07-26T08:58:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,build-essential should be in the apt cache. did you cut and paste the line from the webpage into a terminal?
2007-07-26T08:59:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,not cut and paste...
2007-07-26T08:59:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,then try it and see if it works
2007-07-26T09:02:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,it just says to isnert the edgy cd and hit enter so i do and then it doesnt load the cd or work
2007-07-26T09:06:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"i've really got to be getting to do some work now. the package manager is still trying to get packages from the cd, which isn't good. you can open /etc/apt/sources.list in a text editor 'sudo nano -w /etc/apt/sources.list' and comment out (add a '#' at the start of the line) any lines which look like they refer to a cd. then run 'sudo apt-get update'"
2007-07-26T09:06:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"lots of luck, i gotta be going."
2007-07-26T15:27:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,now in Synaptic click 'refresh' and then try to install the same packages again
2007-07-26T15:52:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,not yet. enter '/etc/init.d/gdm stop'
2007-07-26T15:57:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,what does it say when it fails? it should first offer to download a kernel from nvidia.org
2007-07-26T15:58:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,and then what did it do? it shoudl offer to build the correct interface to the kernel itself
2007-07-26T16:01:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,okay. and then?
2007-07-27T16:03:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"okay, that's the error message i needed"
2007-07-27T16:03:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,enter the following: 'apt-get install linux-source-`uname -r`
2007-07-27T16:35:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,cool :) okay: 'cd' just by itself. and then 'sh NVIDIA*'
2007-07-26T16:16:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,howlingmadhowie: if thats what sony says
2007-07-26T16:09:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"what tells you to enter a command? does some sort of graphical interface start, or does it look like an old dos window?"
2007-07-26T16:10:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,please don't use <enter> for punctuation :)
2007-07-26T16:12:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"then you are now on the command line. what sort of graphics card do you have, and what command did it suggest exactly?"
2007-07-26T16:12:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,fixable?
2007-07-26T16:13:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,don't know yet. probably. if you saw a windowing environment when you installed (i.e. you installed from a standard live cd) then it most definately is fixable
2007-07-26T16:13:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,installed from text mode
2007-07-26T16:14:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,so what's your graphics card? 'lspci | grep VGA'
2007-07-26T16:14:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,nvidia
2007-07-26T16:14:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,which model?
2007-07-26T16:15:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,no clue.... sony vaio vgn-ar520e
2007-07-26T16:15:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,is the computer model number
2007-07-26T16:16:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,GeForce 8400M GT
2007-07-26T16:16:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,but thats supported isnt it?
2007-07-26T16:17:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"i'd suggest changing the video driver back to something very simple. like 'vesa'. can you manage that yourself, or should i tell you how to do that?"
2007-07-26T16:18:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,please tell
2007-07-26T16:18:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"okay. from where you are now, type the following: cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.old"

2007-07-26T16:21:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,do i type all of that in one enter?
2007-07-26T16:21:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"yep. hangon, i'll paste something on pastebin"
2007-07-26T16:23:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,it says the commands not found
2007-07-26T16:23:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,guide me through how to enter all this.... lol

2007-07-26T16:27:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,let me know how far you get
2007-07-26T16:27:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,stuck
2007-07-26T16:27:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,i enter >sudo -i and it says command not found
2007-07-26T16:30:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,enter 'which sudo'. does it say something or does the prompt come straight back?
2007-07-26T16:31:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,now it says root@ubuntu:~# so what do i type now?
2007-07-26T16:31:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,they didnt work... i dont know what im doing wrong.... what exactly do i type after that?
2007-07-26T16:32:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"after you have root access (which you now have), type 'cd /etc/X11'"

2007-07-26T16:35:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"cd = change directory, cp = copy"
2007-07-26T16:35:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,ok now what?
2007-07-26T16:36:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"type 'ls'. do you see an xorg.conf? do you see any other files starting with xorg.conf (for example xorg.conf.backup)? if so, what are they called?"
2007-07-26T16:36:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,xorg.conf and xorg.conf.old
2007-07-26T16:37:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"okay. try the following: 'cat xorg.conf | grep Device'. do you see the word 'nvidia', 'nv', or 'vesa'? if so, which one?"
2007-07-26T16:38:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,it just loaded the same roo ubuntu etc x11 thingy and shown nothing
2007-07-26T16:39:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"hang on. if you enter 'cat xorg.conf', do you get a lot of text whizzing by?"
2007-07-26T16:40:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,yeah....
2007-07-26T16:40:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"okay, we're going to open a text editor and edit xorg.conf. enter the following: 'nano -w xorg.conf'"
2007-07-26T16:41:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,now?
2007-07-26T16:42:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,use the arrow keys to scroll down the text until you find the Section 'Device'
2007-07-26T16:43:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,inputdevice?
2007-07-26T16:43:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,oh nvm... found it
2007-07-26T16:43:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,what's the name of the Driver?
2007-07-26T16:43:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,nv
2007-07-26T16:44:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,okay. change the driver to 'vesa'
2007-07-26T16:44:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,just backspace and type it in?
2007-07-26T16:44:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,exactly
2007-07-26T16:44:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,ok... now what?
2007-07-26T16:45:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"type Ctrl+O to save, and Ctrl+X to quit"
2007-07-26T16:45:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,is that zero or a o ?
2007-07-26T16:45:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,that's an 'o' like oscar :)
2007-07-26T16:46:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,ok all saved and i ctrl-x now what?
2007-07-26T16:46:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,oh yeah it wrote 159 lines
2007-07-26T16:46:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,type '/etc/init.d/?dm restart'
2007-07-26T16:47:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,works so far
2007-07-26T16:47:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,=D wow
2007-07-26T16:48:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"you should get some sort of windowing environment. the resolution is probably awful, but it's a start. the next job is to install the correct driver (vesa is just there to help you out in an emergency)"
2007-07-26T16:48:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,how do i turn on all the cool windows effects?
2007-07-26T16:50:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"until you've installed the correct driver, the 3d effects won't work. as i don't have a modern nvidia card, i don't know which driver you should install now. try searching ubuntuforums.org. something else you can try is System->Administration->'management of limited drivers' (or whatever it's called in your system language (I'm using german myself, so that's just a rough translation))"
2007-07-26T16:50:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,why is it have horrible speed issues on 2000ddr memory?
2007-07-26T16:51:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"if the windowing environment is slow, it's because you're using the vesa driver. it's just there to help out in an emergency. these issues will be resolved when you instlal the correct driver"
2007-07-26T16:51:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,from the nvidia website?
2007-07-26T16:52:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,i'd be surprised if you have to go to the bother to go to the nvidia website. i'd imagine you can install them using synaptic packet manager
2007-07-26T16:53:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,i have a sony vaio vgn-ar520e model.... errr any idea what my driver is and if synaptic will have it?
2007-07-26T16:56:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,i imagine that will be the newest nvidia driver
2007-07-26T16:56:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,is that driver compatible?
2007-07-26T16:56:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,im on 6.10 ghusty....
2007-07-26T16:56:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,someone told me too... ><;
2007-07-26T16:57:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"6.10 edgy eft, or 7.10 gutsy gibbon?"
2007-07-26T16:57:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,edgy thats is
2007-07-26T16:57:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,whats the difference in all of them?
2007-07-26T16:58:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"i'd try opening 'System->Administration->Synaptic package manager', search for 'nvidia' and then select 'nvidia-glx'. click on install"
2007-07-26T16:58:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"well, the first two numbers tell you the date the distribution was launched (6.10 is october 2006)"
2007-07-26T16:59:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,it asked for acd so im letting it load =] 
2007-07-26T05:00:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"i'd really install 7.04 in your case. there's no point using older software. if you have a fast internet connection, you can update 6.10 to 7.04 without needing to reinstall. what's acd?"
2007-07-26T05:00:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"oh, a cd :)"
2007-07-26T05:00:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,and this will install the driver and add a better visual to the screen also make the screen resolution fit?
2007-07-26T05:00:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"if this works, this will mean you are using the official nvidia display driver"
2007-07-26T05:01:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,you may have to set the resolution yourself (i'm not sure how good the driver is at guessing the right resolution to use)
2007-07-26T05:01:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,i did the restart like it asked
2007-07-26T05:02:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,and did it work?
2007-07-26T05:02:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,i dunno its booting =p
2007-07-26T05:02:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,yeah it shows picture still...
2007-07-26T05:03:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,that's a good sign. let's see if 3d acceleration is working. what happens if you do the following: Alt+F2: 'glxgears' <enter>
2007-07-26T05:03:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,soooo how do i go about adding them cool effects to burn the screen away when closed and make them wobble and alternate and stuff all cool?
2007-07-26T05:05:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,i'd recommend updating to 7.04 before you do anything else. did you try the command i gave you?
2007-07-26T05:05:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,hm? what command? im installing updates =D
2007-07-26T05:18:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,my wireless internet i havent tried yet.... photoshop.... and the upgrade wont work
2007-07-26T05:06:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,Alt+F2: 'glxgears' <enter>
2007-07-26T05:06:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,its just doing nothing?
2007-07-26T05:08:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,that's not a good sign. try: Alt+F2 'nvidia-settings' <enter>
2007-07-26T05:08:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,loaded
2007-07-26T05:10:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,i think i'd really recommend updating to 7.04. (so either installing new or using the system update option in the update manager)
2007-07-26T05:10:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,i am right after the updates.... whys it so important to upgrade?
2007-07-26T05:11:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,because 7.04 is better than 6.10 :)
2007-07-26T05:11:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,alrighty
2007-07-26T05:11:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,and there's no reason not to
2007-07-26T05:11:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,will i have the cool screen effects?
2007-07-26T05:12:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"but updating will probably take about an hour. you should be able to activate the cube and wobbly-windows straight away. i've only got a really old graphics card myself, so i don't use them (i also find some software which i use doesn't like the cube effects)"
2007-07-26T05:13:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,i love the cube and wobbly windows.... then i want it to where when i close a windows it like glows from bottom to top... like its glowing it away and when a windows minimized or maximized it like squished up and stufff
2007-07-26T05:18:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,there are only 3 more problems
2007-07-26T05:20:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"wireless: depends on what wireless card you have. support is a lot better in 7.04 than in 6.10. photoshop: there isn't a linux version of this. you can try to use the windows version in an emulator or install windows in a virtual machine inside linux, or use the gimp (which is about as powerful, but the GUI is very different). if the upgrade isn't working, i'd suggest downloading the 7.04 cd and installing new"
2007-07-26T05:21:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,upgrades working now...
2007-07-26T05:22:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,theres a linux version of photoshop?
2007-07-26T05:22:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,not in this century there isn't.
2007-07-26T05:22:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,so im guessing i would use wine.... ?
2007-07-26T05:23:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"you can try wine, it may work. installing it inside a windows virtual machine is the sure fire answer. that will always work. however, i'd recommend having a look at the gimp at some stage. it is extremely powerful (it is used for example to touch up the special effects for the harry potter films amongst others)"
2007-07-26T05:24:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,I am not very fond of the gimp and dont really like it
2007-07-26T05:24:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,then you're going to have to jump through some hoops to get photoshop installed.
2007-07-26T05:25:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,i see.... may i go take a quike shower? its morning here....
2007-07-26T05:27:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,i hearby confer upon Quinton the right to partake in one (1) shower without let or hindrance :)
2007-07-26T05:42:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,and i also wouldn't encourage sony by buying their products :(
2007-07-26T05:33:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,"lmao i read your message, funny. SO the update is almost done"
2007-07-26T05:34:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"after it's updated, you'll have to restart the computer"
2007-07-26T05:34:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,of course
2007-07-26T05:35:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,so after this all i need is to make adobe dreamweaver... photoshop... and pidgin with wireless work... then im set
2007-07-26T05:40:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"dreamweaver is also windows/mac only. a virtual machine looks increasingly to be your best bet here. if you really want to use dreamweaver and photoshop, you should know that adobe doesn't support linux. there is native linux software which is as capable, but you'd have to learn to do things new. in your case, i'd recommend dual-booting and trying out the linux versions, while retaining the windows versions in a wi"
2007-07-26T05:41:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,i would love to dual boot but sony vaio STRICTLY has the harddrive like pined down to not let anyone install xp... only vista
2007-07-26T05:41:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,thus why i got linux
2007-07-26T05:42:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"then your next step will be installing windows xp in a virtual machine inside linux. i've never done that myself, so i can't help much. i'd recommend looking into qemu and kvm"
2007-07-26T05:43:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,the only thing with 2000ddr for 1200$ rather than like 2500$
2007-07-26T05:44:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,17' also
2007-07-26T05:45:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,so howd you learn this much about linux?
2007-07-26T05:46:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,http://lxer.com/module/db/viewby.php?uid=124&sort=120&option=1&value=on&offset=0&dbn=14
2007-07-26T05:47:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,>>; ohhh... yeah i knew that... do you think it will be hard to get photoshop on here?
2007-07-26T05:47:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,I've been using linux for about 3 years now. and i'm very interested in computers. there are however hundreds of thousands of people who know a lot more than i do
2007-07-26T05:48:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,it shouldn't be impossible. first install windows in a virtual machine (check out qemu and kvm). then install photoshop in windows
2007-07-26T05:49:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,mhm...
2007-07-26T05:52:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,Do you have a gf?
2007-07-26T05:52:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,or bf...
2007-07-26T05:52:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,off-topic: i sort of have a bf

2007-07-26T05:53:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"yes, but i'm busy."
2007-07-26T05:54:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,"No offence ( I dont know your gender ) just saying that because almost all of my friends are bi-sexual... but so im not offencive. your a female or male?, also sorry for being off topic"
2007-07-26T05:55:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,way too off-topic.
2007-07-26T05:56:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,=p
2007-07-26T05:57:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,"my appolagies, btw that update is almost done... I had mistaken the time."
2007-07-26T06:00:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"don't worry about it. just bear in mind, that #ubuntu is an international chat channel and that there are some cultures which find the word 'bisexual' offensive and some cultures which find the idea that 'god is watching you' offensive. let's just stay on-topic"
2007-07-26T06:01:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,=]  okey
2007-07-26T06:01:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,i removed the obsolete packages during the upgrade is that ok?
2007-07-26T06:02:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"apt-get (the program which controls upgrades and manages the install packages) is pretty mature software, so i imagine it's fine"
2007-07-26T06:03:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,"alright, it still boots good! a little slower though"
2007-07-26T06:04:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,=[ it says desktop effects cannot be enabled =[
2007-07-26T06:05:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,sounds like the right nvidia driver hasn't been installed. go to 'System->Administration->Manage Restricted Drivers' (or whatever it's called in english)
2007-07-26T06:06:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,gotta install the package?
2007-07-26T06:06:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,sounds good
2007-07-26T06:06:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,no i mean to get into it
2007-07-26T06:07:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"due to licensing restrictions, some drivers can not be installed automatically"
2007-07-26T06:07:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,i see
2007-07-26T06:09:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,wireless doesnt work
2007-07-26T06:09:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,how about the nvidia driver? did that install okay?
2007-07-26T06:10:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,it says my hardware doesnt need any restricted drivers
2007-07-26T06:10:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,strange. the nvidia 8400 most definitely needs restricted drivers
2007-07-26T06:11:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,no clue here...
2007-07-26T06:14:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,according to http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux_display_ia32_100.14.09.html the 8400M GT is supported in the current nvidia driver. it may well be in 'System->Administration->Synaptic Package Manager'
2007-07-26T06:15:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,i found restricted drivers
2007-07-26T06:16:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,lucent/agere linmodem controller driver?
2007-07-26T06:17:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,for your internal modem.
2007-07-26T06:17:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,like my wireless?
2007-07-26T06:18:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"nope. just the modem. getting the wireless to work could be tricky, depending on what chipset sony decided to use"
2007-07-26T06:19:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,I have no idea what chipset they used
2007-07-26T06:19:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,have you found the current nvidia driver in Synaptic Package Manager?
2007-07-26T06:19:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,oh download it from synaptic?
2007-07-26T06:20:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,has lots of restricted things under nvidia
2007-07-26T06:21:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,so d/l nvidia glx new ?
2007-07-26T06:21:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,yep :)
2007-07-26T06:23:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,changes applies...
2007-07-26T06:24:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,sounds good. now you can restart the windowing system ('Ctrl+Alt+Backspace')
2007-07-26T06:25:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,MUCH faster
2007-07-26T06:26:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,thats so fast....
2007-07-26T06:26:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"good. that's probably a good sign. just to make sure, can you do the following: Alt+F2, 'glxgears' <enter>"
2007-07-26T06:26:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,are compiz and beryl ubuntu screen effects?
2007-07-26T06:27:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,it did not do anything
2007-07-26T06:27:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"yeah. the situation with beryl and compiz is quite complicated at the moment. beryl was a fork of the compiz project, now they're getting back together again in something called 'compizfusion' if i recall correctly"
2007-07-26T06:28:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,then maybe you don't have the test program installed. try searching for glxgears in the Synaptic Package Manager and installing it. then repeat Alt+F2 'glxgears' <enter>
2007-07-26T06:29:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,mesa-utils ?
2007-07-26T06:29:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,sounds good
2007-07-26T06:30:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,nope still doesnt do anything
2007-07-26T06:32:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,as shown from videos on youtube compiz fusion work nice...
2007-07-26T06:33:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,then let's get more information. go to 'Applications->Accessories->Terminal'. wait till a terminal appears then enter 'glxgears'.
2007-07-26T06:34:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,"it says 'GLX' missing on display ':0.0'. Error couldnt get an RGB, double-buffered visual"
2007-07-26T06:35:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"i have the feeling this could all go very wrong. one of your main motivations for using ubuntu seems to be the eye candy. i can understand that, but if we can't get photophop and dreamweaver installed in a windows virtual machine, then it doesn't matter how good the eye-candy is"
2007-07-26T06:35:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,that's not a good sign. can you try rebooting the computer?
2007-07-26T06:35:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,of course
2007-07-26T06:36:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,works very quikly... and is now booting back up...
2007-07-26T06:36:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,no.. I never have... even on the preinstalled vista
2007-07-26T06:37:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"as far as i know, before the windowing sysem starts, a big nvidia splash screen appears if you're using the nvida driver"
2007-07-26T06:38:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"as far as i can tell, this means that the nvidia driver still isn't being used. try running 'nvidia-settings'"
2007-07-26T06:38:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,never has...
2007-07-26T06:38:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,works... now what ?
2007-07-26T06:39:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,set the screen resolution you want (in X server display configuration) and then  'Save to X Configuation File'
2007-07-26T06:40:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,thats not there...
2007-07-26T06:41:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,did you manage to start the nvidia-settings program?
2007-07-26T06:42:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,it did
2007-07-26T06:42:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,and you can see a nice grafical software where you can configure your graphics card?
2007-07-26T06:43:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,it just says... enable tooltips.... display status bar. slider text entires. show 'really quit' dialog and unchecked is include c display names in config file
2007-07-26T06:44:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,that sounds like the last page in the software. is there a menu on the left in the window? (X server information... x server display configuration...)
2007-07-26T06:45:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,nvidia-settings configuration: and thats all it says
2007-07-26T06:46:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,and nvidia-settings is installed?
2007-07-26T06:46:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,yeah and when i type a little box pops up
2007-07-26T06:49:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,one second
2007-07-26T06:49:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,ok
2007-07-26T06:54:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"when i enter nvidia-settings, this program is started: http://img228.imageshack.us/img228/2949/bildschirmfotoij2.png"
2007-07-26T06:55:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,not me
2007-07-26T06:57:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"strange. okay. let's do this the direct way. open a terminal, 'sudo -i' 'cd /etc/X11' 'nano -w xorg.conf'"
2007-07-26T06:58:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,got it
2007-07-26T06:58:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"oh, hang on. i've found something interesting. just try in a terminal: 'sudo nvidia-xconfig'"
2007-07-26T07:00:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,doesnt give any options just says 3 lines about using x configuration
2007-07-26T07:00:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,perfect. now restart the windowing system ('Ctrl+Alt+Backspace')
2007-07-26T07:01:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,its just.... black
2007-07-26T07:01:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,nothing?
2007-07-26T07:01:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,nope
2007-07-26T07:01:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,i'm starting to get annoyed with this nvidia driver
2007-07-26T07:01:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,sorry
2007-07-26T07:02:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,ctrl+alt+f2 didnt do anything
2007-07-26T07:03:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,oh
2007-07-26T07:03:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,left alt doesnt work

2007-07-26T07:06:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,no... and this is a laptop
2007-07-26T07:07:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,okay. things have gone pear-shaped. Ctrl-Alt-Backspace doesn't do anything either?

2007-07-26T07:09:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,what to do?
2007-07-26T07:09:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"oh boy. i think the easy way out is to install ubuntu again. looks like the nvidia driver has claimed another victim. if you still think my advice is any good, download the new version (7.04) and install from that disk"
2007-07-26T07:09:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,i cant
2007-07-26T07:10:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,i HAVE to text base install or tty cannot be accesed and job control is turned off...
2007-07-26T07:11:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,plus it wont recognize nvidia just like this time... besides that im already on ver 7.04
2007-07-26T07:11:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,then the alternative install cd for 7.04?
2007-07-26T07:13:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,what do I do?
2007-07-26T07:13:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"hang on, i think we can rescue it."
2007-07-26T07:14:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"restart, and press escape when it tells you to"
2007-07-26T07:14:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,recoverymode?
2007-07-26T07:15:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,nope. change the options for standard boot mode by deleting 'splash' and 'quiet' and adding 'runlevel=3'
2007-07-26T07:16:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,i hit esc... so now what?
2007-07-26T07:16:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,press e
2007-07-26T07:17:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,press e again
2007-07-26T07:17:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,now... ?
2007-07-26T07:18:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,deleted 'quiet' and 'splash' and add 'runlevel=3'
2007-07-26T07:18:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,"i got grub edit> root (hd0,0)"
2007-07-26T07:19:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"oh, sorry. press escape"
2007-07-26T07:19:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,ok now?
2007-07-26T07:19:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,and press escape again until you get up to the top menu
2007-07-26T07:19:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,let's try recovery mode :)
2007-07-26T07:20:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,loading it...
2007-07-26T07:20:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,lots of text should go flying by
2007-07-26T07:21:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,it stoppped and sayysss root@ubuntu:~# select () to /dev/rtc to wait for clock tick timed out
2007-07-26T07:21:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,good. enter 'cd /etc/X11'
2007-07-26T07:22:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,does it complain at all?
2007-07-26T07:22:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,no
2007-07-26T07:22:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,good. let's check to see it did that. enter 'pwd'. do you see /etc/X11 ?
2007-07-26T07:23:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,yeah
2007-07-26T07:23:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,good :) now enter the following 'mv xorg.conf.backup xorg.conf'
2007-07-26T07:23:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,didnt do anything
2007-07-26T07:24:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,maybe it did :) 'ls -lh' what's the date of xorg.conf?
2007-07-26T07:25:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,08:59
2007-07-26T07:25:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"mm, hang on. when you enter 'ls' what files to you see which start with 'xorg.conf'?"
2007-07-26T07:26:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,conf and conf old
2007-07-26T07:27:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,sounds good. 'reboot'
2007-07-26T07:27:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,how?
2007-07-26T07:27:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,enter the word 'reboot'
2007-07-26T07:28:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"if the computer doesn't boot again to where we were before we started playing around with the nvidia driver, we'll have to boot again in recovery mode and edit xorg.conf by hand using a text editor (nano)"
2007-07-26T07:28:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,booted
2007-07-26T07:28:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,have you got the windowing environment running? (X server)
2007-07-26T07:29:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,i guess.... ?
2007-07-26T07:29:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,so you can log in normally ?
2007-07-26T07:29:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,yeah
2007-07-26T07:29:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,cool :)
2007-07-26T07:30:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,now then. what do you see under 'System->Administration->Restricted Drivers Manager'?
2007-07-26T07:31:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,the modem thing still
2007-07-26T07:31:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,and still no reference to a graphics card?
2007-07-26T07:32:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,no
2007-07-26T07:32:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,can you open a terminal and type the following: 'lspci | grep VGA'
2007-07-26T07:33:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,says VGA compatible controle nvidia coorp unkown device 0426 (rev a 1)
2007-07-26T07:34:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,it really shouldn't be an unknown device by now. i wonder what's up with the driver. did you get the driver from the cd or from the internet?
2007-07-26T07:35:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,cd...
2007-07-26T07:35:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,a-ha! that could be what's going wrong. the version on the cd is really old.
2007-07-26T07:36:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,start the Synaptic Package Manager and go to Settings->sources
2007-07-26T07:37:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,there is no sources?
2007-07-26T07:38:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,whatever it's called in the language you're using. maybe it's 'package sources' or something similar (under Settings in the navigation for the Synaptic Package Management window)
2007-07-26T07:38:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,"preferences, respriotires, filters, set internal option, toolbar"
2007-07-26T07:39:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,repositories :)
2007-07-26T07:39:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,now?
2007-07-26T07:40:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"activate 'main', 'universe', 'restricted' and 'multiverse'. on one of the tabs of that window there could be a way to switch off the cd as a software source. if you can, do this."
2007-07-26T07:41:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,how do i turn off the cd?
2007-07-26T07:42:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,hang on. my laptop is in english. i'll just boot it and see how to do that
2007-07-26T07:43:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,ok i removed cd option and turned o nwhat you said now what?
2007-07-26T07:44:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,shut the repositories dialog screen and click 'Reload' on the main Synaptic Package Management screen
2007-07-26T07:45:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,shut Synaptic Package Manager and start 'System->Administration->Update Manager'
2007-07-26T07:46:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,nothing
2007-07-26T07:47:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,click 'Check'
2007-07-26T07:47:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,nothing
2007-07-26T07:48:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,then it must have got the new nvidia version from the net. which of course doesn't answer the question as to why it doesn't appear in the restricted drivers list
2007-07-26T07:50:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,okay. the next approach would be to download the nvidia driver directly from nvidia.com and install it.
2007-07-26T07:51:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,find the driver for me? =[ I think I will mess up
2007-07-26T07:55:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,have a look at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=441658&highlight=8400m and https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NvidiaManual
2007-07-26T07:55:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"if you have any problems, let me know. i should really be getting to do some work now"
2007-07-26T08:03:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,i tired the instructions and it says i cannot find the file i downloaded after following nvidias strict instructions
2007-07-26T08:05:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,where did you download the file to? can you see it on your desktop?
2007-07-26T08:05:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,yes
2007-07-26T08:06:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,good. then open a terminal and enter 'cd Desktop'. you should now be able to see the driver (enter 'ls')
2007-07-26T08:07:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,no such file or drectory
2007-07-26T08:07:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,what does 'pwd' say?
2007-07-26T08:08:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,/home/quinton
2007-07-26T08:08:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,'cd Desktop'
2007-07-26T08:09:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,no such file or drectory
2007-07-26T08:10:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,'ls' what do you see?
2007-07-26T08:10:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,desktop examples sudo
2007-07-26T08:15:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"sorry, my boss just called :) so, where were we? 'ls' replies that there is a file called 'desktop' (which surprises me because it is usually called 'Desktop') and when you enter 'cd Desktop' it replies 'no such file or directory'."
2007-07-26T08:16:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,i just need step by step for beryl and nvidia?
2007-07-26T08:17:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,i can do everything else on my own
2007-07-26T08:17:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,and you're sure you entered 'cd Desktop' and not 'cd desktop'?
2007-07-26T08:18:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,oh... ok so whats next lol ?
2007-07-26T08:19:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,i'd move the driver to the /root directory.
2007-07-26T08:19:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,wheres that?
2007-07-26T08:20:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,enter 'sudo -i' and your password. then 'mv /home/quinton/Desktop/NVIDIA* $HOME'
2007-07-26T08:21:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,just put a >
2007-07-26T08:23:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,sounds good. enter 'cd $HOME'
2007-07-26T08:23:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,just loaded root@ubuntu again
2007-07-26T08:25:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,and what do 'pwd' and 'ls' now say?
2007-07-26T08:26:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,/root and root@ubuntu:~#
2007-07-26T08:27:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"there's nothing in the directory? strange. 'ls /home/quinton/Desktop'. is the driver you downloaded from the nvidia website still there? if yes, can you write the first 5 letters?"
2007-07-26T08:28:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,write the first 5 letters?
2007-07-26T08:29:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,just tell me the first 5 letters
2007-07-26T08:30:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,NVIDI ?
2007-07-26T08:31:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,okay. now on the console (assuming you still have a root prompt) enter 'mv /home/quinton/Desktop/NVIDI* $HOME'
2007-07-26T08:32:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,no destination
2007-07-26T08:34:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"okay, you're typing something wrongly. try this 'mv /home/quinton/Desktop/NVIDI* /root'"
2007-07-26T08:34:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,says root@ubuntu etc...
2007-07-26T08:35:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,now what?
2007-07-26T08:36:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,okay: 'cd' and 'ls'. you should see the NVIDIA driver
2007-07-26T08:36:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,yes
2007-07-26T08:39:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,now?
2007-07-26T08:40:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"cool. now you can carry on with the instructions on the nvidia site ( or on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NvidiaManual ). just remember to 'sudo -i' to get to a root window, and then 'cd /root' to get to the directory with the driver in it before running 'sh ./NVIDIA*' again, otherwise you won't find it"
2007-07-26T08:42:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,it say to turn off x server before install ?
2007-07-26T08:44:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"to do that, enter 'Ctrl+Alt+F2'. log in. 'sudo -i', enter password. '/etc/init.d/gdm stop'"
2007-07-26T08:45:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,then how do i get back to the nvidia installer?
2007-07-26T08:46:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,now enter 'sh ./NVIDIA*'
2007-07-26T08:46:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,and follow the on screen instructions
2007-07-26T08:47:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,wtf... no matching precompiled kernel interface was found on NVIDIA
2007-07-26T08:47:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,it cant find a precompiled kernel
2007-07-26T08:48:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,ERROR: you do not appear to have libc header files installed on your system. Please install your distibution's libc development package ?
2007-07-26T08:49:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,okay. you'll need that. quit the installation and follow the instructions on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NvidiaManual
2007-07-26T08:50:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,you can return to the X server by entering ctrl+alt+f7
2007-07-26T08:54:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,upon installing the essentials it says it couldnt find the package
2007-07-26T08:56:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,i'm wondering if i can dial in from outside and do this for you. it's starting to take way to long
2007-07-26T08:57:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,please?
2007-07-26T08:58:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,build-essential should be in the apt cache. did you cut and paste the line from the webpage into a terminal?
2007-07-26T08:59:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,not cut and paste...
2007-07-26T08:59:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,then try it and see if it works
2007-07-26T09:02:00.000Z,Quinton_,howlingmadhowie,it just says to isnert the edgy cd and hit enter so i do and then it doesnt load the cd or work
2007-07-26T09:06:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"i've really got to be getting to do some work now. the package manager is still trying to get packages from the cd, which isn't good. you can open /etc/apt/sources.list in a text editor 'sudo nano -w /etc/apt/sources.list' and comment out (add a '#' at the start of the line) any lines which look like they refer to a cd. then run 'sudo apt-get update'"
2007-07-26T09:06:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"lots of luck, i gotta be going."
2007-07-26T15:27:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,now in Synaptic click 'refresh' and then try to install the same packages again
2007-07-26T15:52:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,not yet. enter '/etc/init.d/gdm stop'
2007-07-26T15:57:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,what does it say when it fails? it should first offer to download a kernel from nvidia.org
2007-07-26T15:58:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,and then what did it do? it shoudl offer to build the correct interface to the kernel itself
2007-07-26T16:01:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,okay. and then?
2007-07-27T16:03:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,"okay, that's the error message i needed"
2007-07-27T16:03:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,enter the following: 'apt-get install linux-source-`uname -r`
2007-07-27T16:35:00.000Z,howlingmadhowie,Quinton_,cool :) okay: 'cd' just by itself. and then 'sh NVIDIA*'
