2006-02-28T15:57:00.000Z,Seveas,gnomefreak,?
2006-02-28T15:58:00.000Z,gnomefreak,Seveas,i was told that the reason they pulled xubuntu out of dapper was upgrading to newest version and mine still isnt right (unless its that different)
2006-02-28T15:58:00.000Z,Seveas,gnomefreak,"xubuntu-desktop should be installable right now, otherwise poke janimo in #xubuntu"
2006-02-28T16:34:00.000Z,Seveas,gnomefreak,you need to purge all apps
2006-02-28T16:34:00.000Z,Seveas,gnomefreak,little tip: dpkg -l | grep '^rc'
2006-02-28T16:34:00.000Z,gnomefreak,Seveas,ty
2006-02-28T16:35:00.000Z,Seveas,gnomefreak,if that output only package you have removed and want purged: dpkg -l | grep '^rc' | xargs sudo dpkg -P
2006-03-01T17:25:00.000Z,Seveas,gnomefreak,nonsense 
2006-03-01T17:25:00.000Z,gnomefreak,Seveas,sudo apt-get upgrade will hold back kernel

2006-03-05T16:13:00.000Z,Seveas,gnomefreak,It *may* work but you should absolutely install it immediately afterwards and don't mess with hardware (and don't even think about rebooting
2006-03-05T16:14:00.000Z,gnomefreak,Seveas,ok ill try it and pray it works if not ill be re-installing i guess lol
2006-03-05T16:14:00.000Z,gnomefreak,Seveas,sudo apt-get remove --reinstall hal    will that work?
2006-03-05T16:17:00.000Z,Seveas,gnomefreak,hal has very little to do with the gnome panel...
