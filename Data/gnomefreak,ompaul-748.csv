2005-11-17T16:48:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,dapper is there - it is before beta if that is possible - use only if you fully understand it :-)
2005-11-17T16:48:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak, i.e. second machine you can afford to break
2005-11-17T16:49:00.000Z,gnomefreak,ompaul,im not touching it for a while lol

2005-11-25T06:27:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,"if is how the other improvements were made, you have to start somewhere"
2005-11-25T06:28:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,s/if/it
2005-11-25T06:30:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,would you ever try to upgrade from SuSE to or from Rehat/Fedora or to or from Mandriva? ;-)
2005-11-25T06:31:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,LFS ?
2005-11-25T06:36:00.000Z,gnomefreak,ompaul,i dont see me using that do to that fact that that is harder than well debian im sure
2005-11-25T15:21:00.000Z,gnomefreak,ompaul,is openbox gdm or odm?
2005-11-25T15:21:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,no idea
2005-11-25T15:25:00.000Z,gnomefreak,ompaul, i asked you sir
2005-11-25T15:26:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,after saying no to you I got a longer version of a very similar question from n0dl
2005-11-25T15:26:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,:-)
2005-12-06T16:15:00.000Z,gnomefreak,ompaul,does he have the cdrom source in there?
2005-12-06T16:16:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,we will know in a second when he shows us the source :)
2005-12-06T16:19:00.000Z,gnomefreak,ompaul,it doesnt work with the cdrom source i tried that 3 times over the past few weeks
2005-12-06T16:22:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,he needs it for the package he wants
2005-12-06T16:26:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,considering the work your doing if I was doing that I would find out if they wanted multiverse
2005-12-06T16:28:00.000Z,gnomefreak,ompaul, only issue there is he only has the backported multis in there not the archive ones and my website may not be best example of sourcves list lol
2005-12-06T16:30:00.000Z,gnomefreak,ompaul,is that the right command for that package?
2005-12-06T16:31:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,don't know synaptic that well (came from the other apt get world via a long and funny route)
2005-12-06T16:32:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,under 'edit' fix broken packages
2005-12-06T16:49:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,not what he asked :-(
2005-12-06T16:49:00.000Z,gnomefreak,ompaul, i know but im here to give the truth ;)
2005-12-06T16:50:00.000Z,gnomefreak,ompaul,isnt that backwards shhhhhhhhh SteveW you dont see this lol

2005-12-11T13:53:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,s/should/must :-)))
2005-12-14T16:12:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,i read your question for three times what I think you asked was - if you take .deb files and put them on a CD can you install them later just pop them in /var/cache/apt/archives - and then you can install them to your hearts content - however I am only 80% certain this is what you asked - your question does leave a lot of room for it not to have been your question
2005-12-14T16:13:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,as long as it is the 'pre installed' version of the programs - so grab your source and packages and run with them to the burner :)
2006-01-02T16:59:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,java is almost the most evil thing :) is that a bit lighter?
2006-01-07T16:15:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,#ubuntu-offtopic for a sec :)

2006-01-24T11:57:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,I was playing kill the partition this afternoon and to be honest if my brain had been working cating dev random to the hard drive would have saved me a serious amount of time
2006-01-24T11:58:00.000Z,gnomefreak,ompaul,why were you playing kill the partion? sounds like fun but why
2006-01-24T11:58:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,cos write to the partition was not working

2006-03-04T06:12:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,"file-roller is part of gnome - so I imagine it could be removed, why are you thinking about removing it"
2006-03-04T06:13:00.000Z,gnomefreak,ompaul,when i download a tar it puts it into /tmp even though i direct it somewhere else
2006-03-04T06:17:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,"it works perfectly for me, did some tests like created new archives"

2005-11-17T16:48:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,dapper is there - it is before beta if that is possible - use only if you fully understand it :-)
2005-11-17T16:48:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak, i.e. second machine you can afford to break
2005-11-17T16:49:00.000Z,gnomefreak,ompaul,im not touching it for a while lol
2005-11-18T17:20:00.000Z,gnomefreak,ompaul, why bother he cant read the topic?
2005-11-18T17:21:00.000Z,gnomefreak,ompaul, that was more than one :(

2005-11-25T06:27:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,"if is how the other improvements were made, you have to start somewhere"
2005-11-25T06:28:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,s/if/it
2005-11-25T06:30:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,would you ever try to upgrade from SuSE to or from Rehat/Fedora or to or from Mandriva? ;-)
2005-11-25T06:31:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,LFS ?

2005-11-25T15:21:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,no idea
2005-11-25T15:25:00.000Z,gnomefreak,ompaul, i asked you sir
2005-11-25T15:26:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,after saying no to you I got a longer version of a very similar question from n0dl
2005-11-25T15:26:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,:-)
2005-12-06T16:15:00.000Z,gnomefreak,ompaul,does he have the cdrom source in there?
2005-12-06T16:16:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,we will know in a second when he shows us the source :)
2005-12-06T16:19:00.000Z,gnomefreak,ompaul,it doesnt work with the cdrom source i tried that 3 times over the past few weeks
2005-12-06T16:22:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,he needs it for the package he wants
2005-12-06T16:26:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,considering the work your doing if I was doing that I would find out if they wanted multiverse
2005-12-06T16:28:00.000Z,gnomefreak,ompaul, only issue there is he only has the backported multis in there not the archive ones and my website may not be best example of sourcves list lol
2005-12-06T16:30:00.000Z,gnomefreak,ompaul,is that the right command for that package?
2005-12-06T16:31:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,don't know synaptic that well (came from the other apt get world via a long and funny route)
2005-12-06T16:32:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,under 'edit' fix broken packages
2005-12-06T16:49:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,not what he asked :-(
2005-12-06T16:49:00.000Z,gnomefreak,ompaul, i know but im here to give the truth ;)
2005-12-06T16:50:00.000Z,gnomefreak,ompaul,isnt that backwards shhhhhhhhh SteveW you dont see this lol
2005-12-06T16:51:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,bet you his disk is 100G or greated
2005-12-11T13:53:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,s/should/must :-)))
2005-12-14T16:12:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,i read your question for three times what I think you asked was - if you take .deb files and put them on a CD can you install them later just pop them in /var/cache/apt/archives - and then you can install them to your hearts content - however I am only 80% certain this is what you asked - your question does leave a lot of room for it not to have been your question
2005-12-14T16:13:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,as long as it is the 'pre installed' version of the programs - so grab your source and packages and run with them to the burner :)
2006-01-02T16:59:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,java is almost the most evil thing :) is that a bit lighter?
2006-01-07T16:15:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,#ubuntu-offtopic for a sec :)

2006-01-24T11:57:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,I was playing kill the partition this afternoon and to be honest if my brain had been working cating dev random to the hard drive would have saved me a serious amount of time
2006-01-24T11:58:00.000Z,gnomefreak,ompaul,why were you playing kill the partion? sounds like fun but why
2006-01-24T11:58:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,cos write to the partition was not working

2006-03-04T06:12:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,"file-roller is part of gnome - so I imagine it could be removed, why are you thinking about removing it"
2006-03-04T06:13:00.000Z,gnomefreak,ompaul,when i download a tar it puts it into /tmp even though i direct it somewhere else
2006-03-04T06:17:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,"it works perfectly for me, did some tests like created new archives"

2006-03-08T10:18:00.000Z,ompaul,gnomefreak,sudo apt-cache search mesa<<-- I would start looking there
