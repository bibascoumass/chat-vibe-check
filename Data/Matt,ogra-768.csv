2004-11-05T17:58:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,you could put that link in the topic
2004-11-07T16:27:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,i wanna know how many times you have posted that link in the last week :) it must be the most requested info lol
2004-11-07T16:28:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,lol
2004-11-07T16:28:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,i actually got a vi window open with the handfull of links by default....

2004-11-07T16:32:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,can you recommend your favourite cd ripper to me?
2004-11-07T16:33:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,i dont rip cds ;) but i'd take sound juicer if youre not addicted to mp3
2004-11-07T16:33:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,fraid i need mp3 :(
2004-11-07T16:34:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,"there is a way to rip mp3 with SJ, i just dunno how"
2004-11-07T16:34:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,gives me the message that the codec is not installed
2004-11-07T16:40:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,mybe because ubuntu isnt utf8
2004-11-07T16:40:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,ok cool. So what should I put?
2004-11-07T16:41:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,dpkg-reconfigure locale
2004-11-07T16:41:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,what does that do?
2004-11-07T16:41:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,"or locales , i'm not sure"
2004-11-07T16:43:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,i'd take de_DE@UTF-8 *g*
2004-11-07T16:44:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,but that wont help if youre not german
2004-11-07T16:44:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,en_GB.UTF-8 UTF-8 then i guess ;)
2004-11-07T16:44:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,do you recommend i set that as default?
2004-11-07T16:45:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,"you can, but there are still smoe minor bugs..... bash i think"
2004-11-07T16:45:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,"hmm. if i don't set to default, do you think it will still solve the mp3 tag problem?"
2004-11-07T16:47:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,if you encode now in utf your sys doesnt know how to handle this....if it's capable of utf its more likely to work
2004-11-07T16:48:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,i guess if it doesn't work i can set grip to tag the mp3's with ISO
2004-11-09T16:18:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,did i do something wrong? ;)
2004-11-09T16:19:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,"no, but i asked lamont last if it wouldnt be better to have anonymous builddirs ;)"
2004-11-09T16:20:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,"lamont, just slap me down if i'm being annoying"
2004-11-09T16:20:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,i just asked on the off chance
2004-11-09T16:20:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,because i thought he'd get this kind of questions.....
2004-11-09T16:20:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,"if you made the suggestion, you must have thought that those kind of questions are bad in some way. Hence, i DID do something wrong ;)"
2004-11-09T16:21:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,i dont think he's annoyed by your questions ;) its just the way its set up so he'll  bear them.....
2004-11-09T16:22:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,oh i c
2004-11-09T16:22:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,so the name does not mean that he knows the answer
2004-11-09T16:23:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,he is just the guy who runs the mass builds... you could try to find the debian maintainer of the pkg to help you out if he doesnt mind
2004-11-09T16:30:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,you still there?
2004-11-10T17:19:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,yeah that is a nice touch

2004-11-10T09:41:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,how to get a testing version?
2004-11-10T09:42:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,do that only if you got a spare machine to run it on
2004-11-10T09:42:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,Hoary is supposed to break in the dev process....its a devlopment version....

2004-11-10T09:43:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,i am happy to install a testing OS
2004-11-10T09:44:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,"go on, but dont mix the dists.... if you switch to hoary do it completely and dont cry if nothing works anymore"
2004-11-10T09:44:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,hmm no i won't cry: but the dists can't be mixed? How come?
2004-11-10T09:45:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,didn't you start from warty when making hoary?
2004-11-10T09:45:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,"they can, but youre on your own, nobody will support taht"
2004-11-10T09:45:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,sure

2004-11-20T17:32:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,the second CD ?
2004-11-20T17:32:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,that second cd button you speak of
2004-11-20T17:34:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,nope... you click on the CD in the first win after you added files to the win.....then you get the options ....
2004-11-20T17:34:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,i didn't get many options
2004-11-20T17:34:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,"if you click the cd in the options win, the burning starts"
2004-11-20T17:35:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,oh ok; i understood you to mean that the 2 second between tracks was in that window
2004-11-20T17:35:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,will be deleted on reboot.....
2004-11-20T17:35:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,there is no such option.....
2004-11-20T17:35:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,/dev links are deleted on reboot?
2004-11-20T17:36:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,you can configure udev
2004-11-20T17:37:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,so how do you configure udev?
2004-11-20T17:37:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,i am used to adding links
2004-11-20T17:38:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,ls /etc/udev/
2004-11-20T17:38:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,and have fun....breaking your system *g*
2004-11-20T17:38:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,actually that would have been a good time to say rtfm

2004-11-20T17:39:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,i do.... dont ask how often i broke mine whrn udev was new
2004-11-20T17:39:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,oh well fortunately /dev/cdrom exists ok in my case
2004-11-20T17:39:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,you know what annoys me with this cd burning technique?
2004-11-20T17:39:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,i will.... mrburns is just in early state

2004-11-05T17:58:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,you could put that link in the topic
2004-11-07T16:27:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,i wanna know how many times you have posted that link in the last week :) it must be the most requested info lol
2004-11-07T16:28:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,lol

2004-11-07T16:32:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,can you recommend your favourite cd ripper to me?
2004-11-07T16:33:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,i dont rip cds ;) but i'd take sound juicer if youre not addicted to mp3
2004-11-07T16:33:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,fraid i need mp3 :(
2004-11-07T16:34:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,"there is a way to rip mp3 with SJ, i just dunno how"
2004-11-07T16:34:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,gives me the message that the codec is not installed
2004-11-07T16:40:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,mybe because ubuntu isnt utf8
2004-11-07T16:40:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,ok cool. So what should I put?
2004-11-07T16:41:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,dpkg-reconfigure locale
2004-11-07T16:41:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,what does that do?
2004-11-07T16:41:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,"or locales , i'm not sure"
2004-11-07T16:43:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,i'd take de_DE@UTF-8 *g*
2004-11-07T16:44:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,but that wont help if youre not german
2004-11-07T16:44:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,en_GB.UTF-8 UTF-8 then i guess ;)
2004-11-07T16:44:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,do you recommend i set that as default?
2004-11-07T16:45:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,"you can, but there are still smoe minor bugs..... bash i think"
2004-11-07T16:45:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,"hmm. if i don't set to default, do you think it will still solve the mp3 tag problem?"
2004-11-07T16:47:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,if you encode now in utf your sys doesnt know how to handle this....if it's capable of utf its more likely to work
2004-11-07T16:48:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,i guess if it doesn't work i can set grip to tag the mp3's with ISO
2004-11-09T16:18:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,did i do something wrong? ;)
2004-11-09T16:19:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,"no, but i asked lamont last if it wouldnt be better to have anonymous builddirs ;)"
2004-11-09T16:20:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,"lamont, just slap me down if i'm being annoying"
2004-11-09T16:20:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,i just asked on the off chance
2004-11-09T16:20:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,because i thought he'd get this kind of questions.....
2004-11-09T16:20:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,"if you made the suggestion, you must have thought that those kind of questions are bad in some way. Hence, i DID do something wrong ;)"
2004-11-09T16:21:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,i dont think he's annoyed by your questions ;) its just the way its set up so he'll  bear them.....
2004-11-09T16:22:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,oh i c
2004-11-09T16:22:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,so the name does not mean that he knows the answer
2004-11-09T16:23:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,he is just the guy who runs the mass builds... you could try to find the debian maintainer of the pkg to help you out if he doesnt mind
2004-11-09T16:30:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,you still there?
2004-11-10T17:19:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,yeah that is a nice touch

2004-11-10T09:42:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,do that only if you got a spare machine to run it on

2004-11-10T09:43:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,i am happy to install a testing OS
2004-11-10T09:44:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,"go on, but dont mix the dists.... if you switch to hoary do it completely and dont cry if nothing works anymore"
2004-11-10T09:44:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,hmm no i won't cry: but the dists can't be mixed? How come?
2004-11-10T09:45:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,didn't you start from warty when making hoary?
2004-11-10T09:45:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,"they can, but youre on your own, nobody will support taht"
2004-11-10T09:45:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,sure

2004-11-20T17:34:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,nope... you click on the CD in the first win after you added files to the win.....then you get the options ....

2004-11-20T17:35:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,there is no such option.....

2004-11-20T17:40:00.000Z,Matt|,ogra,is there anyway to prevent nautilus taking over the screen when i click and hold on files to drag them (i.e. the target window remains active)?
2004-11-20T17:40:00.000Z,ogra,Matt|,"nope, i dont thonk so....."
