2008-04-02T23:04:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,,"Doing 'sudo ndiswrapper -i bcmwl.inf' gies 'driver bcmwl5 is already instaleld', but it also says 'driver 'bcml5' is not instlaled (properly)!'"
2008-04-02T23:04:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,,How do I uninstall the driver and reinstall it?
2008-04-02T23:05:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,,How do I uninstall a driver?
2008-04-02T23:05:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,blacklist it
2008-04-02T23:05:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,How do I do that?
2008-04-02T23:06:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,then type the driver in there and save
2008-04-02T23:06:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,then restart
2008-04-02T23:06:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,So it opens up the text editor.
2008-04-02T23:07:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,I just save it? Without doing anything?
2008-04-02T23:07:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"no, write the name at the bottom of the list of the driver"
2008-04-02T23:07:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,then save
2008-04-02T23:08:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Okay, now I restart the computer?"
2008-04-02T23:08:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,FATAL: Module bcml5.inf not found.
2008-04-02T23:09:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,wait are you trying to remove a driver from ndiswrapper?
2008-04-02T23:09:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,ndiswrapper already installed a driver but it installed improperly.
2008-04-02T23:09:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,or are you trying to stop ndiswrapper all together? what are you trying to do in the first place?
2008-04-02T23:09:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,So I'm trying to *uninstall* the driver and reinstall it properly.
2008-04-02T23:10:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,then type this; sudo ndiswrapper -r <driver name>
2008-04-02T23:11:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,'couldn't delete /etc/ndiswrapper/bcmwl5.inf: No such file or directory'
2008-04-02T23:11:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,type ndiswrapper -L but lowercase L
2008-04-02T23:11:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,and paste the output
2008-04-02T23:11:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,type sudo ndiswrapper -r bcmwl5
2008-04-02T23:11:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,This is on another laptop.
2008-04-02T23:12:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,i was going thru the exact same thing you are
2008-04-02T23:12:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,you should just forget tryin to get ur bcm card to work and go get yourself a wireless bridge
2008-04-02T23:12:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Actually, I got it to work *perfectly* yesterday."
2008-04-02T23:13:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,But my sound and video card settings were thoroughly messed up so I installed a clean copy again.
2008-04-02T23:13:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"the problem with the bcm stuff is that it slowly 'decays', and sometimes quickly"
2008-04-02T23:13:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"it could be working perfectly for 10 mins or 10 hrs, then all of a sudden stop working all together"
2008-04-02T23:14:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"thats why i went with a wireless bridge lol, wayyyyyyyy easier to set up"
2008-04-02T23:14:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Well, it was working fine from about 12PM to 3AM yesterday."
2008-04-02T23:14:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,but it randomly stopped huh? mine did the same thing
2008-04-02T23:14:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,and i tried to get it working for like 3 months to no avail
2008-04-02T23:15:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,No.
2008-04-02T23:15:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,It was working fine.
2008-04-02T23:15:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,I just reinstalled Ubuntu.
2008-04-02T23:15:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,I reinstalled due to problems with my sound and video card.
2008-04-02T23:15:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"i reinstalled after i started having problems again with bcm, and i never got it working again"
2008-04-02T23:16:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Broadcom.
2008-04-02T23:16:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,One second.
2008-04-02T23:16:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,mines BCM4311MCG for example
2008-04-02T23:16:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Broadcom Corporation BCM4328 802.11a/b/g/n
2008-04-02T23:16:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,k gimme a few
2008-04-02T23:16:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,I think all I need to do is follow the 'INSTALL' in this ndiswrapper 1.52 tar.gz file.
2008-04-02T23:17:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,That's how I got it to work the first time.
2008-04-02T23:17:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,64 or 32-bit?
2008-04-02T23:17:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,32
2008-04-02T23:18:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,k gimme a few
2008-04-02T23:18:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,hey did you blacklist bcm43xx when you installed ndiswrapper?
2008-04-02T23:19:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Yes, I believe I did."
2008-04-02T23:19:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Sorry, can you paste the command to go to the blacklist again?"
2008-04-02T23:19:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,and also check ifthere is a # to the left of it
2008-04-02T23:20:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,There's a 'blacklist bcm43xx' above the 'blacklist bcmwl5'.
2008-04-02T23:20:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,You told me to do the second one.
2008-04-02T23:21:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"yea get rid of the bcmwl5 entry, i didn't know u were doin stuff with ndiswrapper"
2008-04-02T23:21:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,do you have a flash drive?
2008-04-02T23:21:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Okay.
2008-04-02T23:22:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Yes, I do. That's how I've been getting these files onto my laptop."
2008-04-02T23:22:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"k, if you could paste the output of ndiswrapper -l in a text document and transfer it to the machine ur on then pastebin it"
2008-04-02T23:22:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,How do I open the text editor for the blacklist?
2008-04-02T23:23:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,sudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
2008-04-02T23:23:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Okay, I saved that."
2008-04-02T23:23:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,ndiswrapper -l gives two things:
2008-04-02T23:24:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,sudo ndiswrapper -r bcmwl5
2008-04-02T23:24:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,then do ndiswrapper -l again
2008-04-02T23:24:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Okay, I did that."
2008-04-02T23:25:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,'bcmwl5 : invalid driver!'
2008-04-02T23:25:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Only once this time.
2008-04-02T23:25:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,then do the sudo ndiswrapper -r bcmwl5 again
2008-04-02T23:26:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,'couldn't delete /etc/ndiswrapper/bcmwl5: No such file or directory'

2008-04-02T23:26:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"okay, ill give you a link to downoad a good driver, gimme a second"
2008-04-02T23:27:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Okay.
2008-04-02T23:28:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,wut kinda computer is it?
2008-04-02T23:29:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,HP dv6000

2008-04-02T23:34:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,then u gotta get the drivers and firmware out of it with cabextract
2008-04-02T23:34:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,It's an .exe. Where do I install it?
2008-04-02T23:34:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Okay.
2008-04-02T23:34:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,gimme a sec ill find it for ya
2008-04-02T23:35:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,http://packages.ubuntu.com/feisty/utils/cabextract and click the i386 one
2008-04-02T23:36:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,lemme know when you have both of those downloaded
2008-04-02T23:36:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Okay.
2008-04-02T23:36:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"So this will get rid of the invalid 'bcmwl5,' too?"
2008-04-02T23:37:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,we're gonna reinstall the drivers
2008-04-02T23:37:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Okay, but ndiswrapper -l still gives the 'bcmwl5 : invalid driver!' right?"
2008-04-02T23:37:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,for now
2008-04-02T23:38:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Okay, just making sure."
2008-04-02T23:39:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Okay, I've just installed 'cabextract.'"
2008-04-02T23:39:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,What do I do now?
2008-04-02T23:39:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,now make a folder called ndiswrapper on ur desktop
2008-04-02T23:39:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Okay.
2008-04-02T23:40:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,and put the sp36684.exe file in there
2008-04-02T23:40:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Okay.
2008-04-02T23:41:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Okay.
2008-04-02T23:41:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,just to make sure sudo ndiswrapper -r bcmwl5 again

2008-04-02T23:44:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,crap i skipped a whole step lol sorry
2008-04-02T23:44:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Yes, the .exe is in the 'ndiswrapper' folder in the Dekstop."
2008-04-02T23:44:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Oh, okay."
2008-04-02T23:44:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"cd in terminal, then cd Desktop/ndswrapper"
2008-04-02T23:44:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,I already did that.

2008-04-02T23:45:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,k then sudo ndiswrapper -i bcmwl5.inf
2008-04-02T23:46:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,driver bcmwl5 is already installed
2008-04-02T23:46:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,ndiswrapper -v
2008-04-02T23:46:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,utils version: 1.9

2008-04-02T23:47:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,ur ndiswrapper isn't installed right..
2008-04-02T23:47:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Oh.
2008-04-02T23:47:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,How do I install it properly?
2008-04-02T23:48:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"wow, thats where all these problems are coming from lol, h/o lemme find somethin for ya"
2008-04-02T23:48:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Haha, okay."
2008-04-02T23:49:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=93482 and download the stable version
2008-04-02T23:50:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,I already have this on my flash drive.
2008-04-02T23:51:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"okay, then gimme one sec.."
2008-04-02T23:52:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,get that folder onto ur comp and cd into it from terminal
2008-04-02T23:53:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Okay, done."
2008-04-02T23:53:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,so ur in the ndiswrapper-1.52 folder right? type sudo make
2008-04-02T23:54:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,That gives *a lot* of errors and warnings.
2008-04-02T23:54:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Most of them start with 'loadndisdriver.c:'
2008-04-02T23:55:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,what when u run make?
2008-04-02T23:55:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,yes.
2008-04-02T23:55:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"hmm.. try a different ndiswrapper file, sounds like that one is missing stuff"
2008-04-02T23:56:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Or, I think my computer is missing some header files or something."
2008-04-02T23:56:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,I think all of them are errors that have to do with the C.
2008-04-02T23:57:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"hmm.. yeah, this is why i gave up on my broadcom card lol"
2008-04-02T23:57:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,A bunch of 'undeclared's and 'implicit declaration's.
2008-04-02T23:57:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"No, I think it has something to do with the Linux kernel itself -- it just cannot recognize the C code or something."
2008-04-02T23:57:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"ill try to find u this really good tutorial i used before, but you'll have to do another couple things before using it"
2008-04-02T23:57:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,paste them
2008-04-02T23:58:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,ill look at them to see wut i can get from it
2008-04-02T23:58:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Where do I put it in Ubuntu?
2008-04-02T23:58:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,A text editor or something?
2008-04-02T23:58:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,yeah
2008-04-02T23:58:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Can Windows recognize it?
2008-04-02T23:58:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,if you open the file from wordpad
2008-04-02T23:59:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Okay, I pasted it into gedit."
2008-04-02T23:59:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,now save the file and ya
2008-04-02T23:59:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,there's a way to save it as .txt but i forgot
2008-04-03T00:01:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,I saved it into my traveldrive but it's not showing up when I plug it into the desktop. . .
2008-04-03T00:02:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"create a .txt file on ur desktop, put it in the drive, then paste the stuff in that file in ubuntu, then back again"
2008-04-03T00:02:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,too complicated lol
2008-04-03T00:02:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Okay. T_T
2008-04-03T00:03:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Okay, I did that, but when I put it into the desktop and open the file, nothing shows up. . ."
2008-04-03T00:04:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,This is like playing 'Whack the Gopher.'
2008-04-03T00:04:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"lol it really is, i remember going back and forth between two laptops, one ubuntu and one windows, until i figured out how to do file sharing lol"
2008-04-03T00:05:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Okay, I got it to work, but it is all bunched up. . ."
2008-04-03T00:05:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"copy and paste it into pastebin, sometimes that fixes the formatting issues"
2008-04-03T00:06:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Oh, right."
2008-04-03T00:06:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,http://pastebin.com/m42f7166
2008-04-03T00:07:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,those files are just missing.. thats all don't worry about ur ubuntu install
2008-04-03T00:07:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Oh, okay."
2008-04-03T00:07:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,So should I reinstall from sourceforge?
2008-04-03T00:07:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"yeah, have u tried using the restricted drivers yet?"
2008-04-03T00:08:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,The only thing in my restricted drivers is the NVIDIA soundcard.
2008-04-03T00:08:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,*video card
2008-04-03T00:08:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,really? hmm.. so u kinda got no choice but to use ndiswrapper
2008-04-03T00:08:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Right. T_T
2008-04-03T00:09:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"first, go into synaptic package manager and uninstall all the ndiswrapper stuff.. ALL of it.."
2008-04-03T00:09:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,the sourceforge dist should be enough
2008-04-03T00:11:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"I said 'completely remove' for both 'ndiswrapper-utils' and 'ndiswrapper-common,' but the error is: 'E: bcm43xx-fwcutter: subprocess post-installation script returned error exit status 1'"
2008-04-03T00:15:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,have u reinstalled ndiswrapper yet?
2008-04-03T00:15:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,'E: bcm43xx-fwcutter: subprocess post-installation script returned error exit status 1'
2008-04-03T00:15:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,whats wrong with ur comp lol
2008-04-03T00:15:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,That's what I go when I tried to completely remove ndiswrapper-common and ndiswrapper-utils.
2008-04-03T00:15:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,yeah.. i have no idea lol
2008-04-03T00:16:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,i never had to deal with any of that
2008-04-03T00:16:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,It's time to Google. =D
2008-04-03T00:16:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Or, it only takes about 20 minutes to clean install."
2008-04-03T00:16:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,yeah it really is lol. my best suggestion to keep you from having any more headaches is to spend $20 on a wireless bridge
2008-04-03T00:16:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,they're really easy to set up
2008-04-03T00:17:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Will I have to go through this ndiswrapper stuff?
2008-04-03T00:17:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,with a wireless bridge? no
2008-04-03T00:17:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,I'll take a look at it.
2008-04-03T00:18:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"to set up a wireless bridge, all you do is set a static ip on ur 'wired connection' in ubuntu, type the ip of the bridge in firefox, and go from there"
2008-04-03T00:18:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"its really, really,really simple"
2008-04-03T00:18:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Hm. But for now, I'll have to get this working."
2008-04-03T00:18:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,no money im guessin lol
2008-04-03T00:19:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,And no time. =D
2008-04-03T00:19:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,it takes alot less time to set up a bridge
2008-04-03T00:19:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,took me five minutes
2008-04-03T00:19:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Can I get one at Circuit City?
2008-04-03T00:20:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,And will the connection be stable?
2008-04-03T00:20:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"yes you can get them at circuit city and yes they're stable, thats how im talkin to ya lol"
2008-04-03T00:20:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Haha, okay. And they are only $20?"
2008-04-03T00:20:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"about that, maybe cheaper"
2008-04-03T00:21:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Sounds great. I'll research them and hopefully I'll be able to get one today.
2008-04-03T00:21:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,ill find u somethin right now lol
2008-04-03T00:22:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"The thing is, I had a very stable (95%+) reception yesterday. . ."
2008-04-03T00:22:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Do you know how I can purge bcm43xx-fwcutter, maybe?"
2008-04-03T00:23:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,no lol.
2008-04-03T00:23:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,u gotta walmart near u?
2008-04-03T00:23:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Yes.
2008-04-03T00:23:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,yeah.. they're cheaper than circuit city lol
2008-04-03T00:24:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,But I don't know if it is *necessary.* I had the wireless connection set up manually and I made it my default and it worked like a charm.
2008-04-03T00:25:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"once my broadcom worked i was happy, but then it stopped working completely, and i haven't gotten it to wrok since"
2008-04-03T00:25:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Okay, I'm going to do a clean install again -- I've already messed with ndiswrapper and the drivers."
2008-04-03T00:25:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Hm, I see."
2008-04-03T00:26:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"yupp,, broadcom is just too much of a headache imo"
2008-04-03T00:26:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,I can't imagine Linux is really friendly to people who actually have things to do.
2008-04-03T00:27:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,it is if you have the right equipment lol
2008-04-03T00:27:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,But I'm a poor N00B. =|
2008-04-03T00:27:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"i like it, just yeah.. it does take alotta time to get it working and stuff"
2008-04-03T00:27:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,im just as much of a noob lol
2008-04-03T00:28:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"At one point yesterday, I had wireless, my screen resolution, sound, *and* Compiz working."
2008-04-03T00:28:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,AND I had my text-based IM client working.
2008-04-03T00:28:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,It was absolutely amazing.
2008-04-03T00:28:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Then I had wanted to make my resolution the default setting.
2008-04-03T00:28:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"yeah it is pretty amazing, i got all of that right now lol"
2008-04-03T00:28:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,So I did something with the NVIDIA-settings.
2008-04-03T00:28:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,i even got the desktop cube thing working. .its really cool lol
2008-04-03T00:28:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Then I lost sound. So I did some stuff at restarted.
2008-04-03T00:28:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Yes, I had nearly every single extra setting on. :D"
2008-04-03T00:29:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,I got sound back but my graphics was still not working.
2008-04-03T00:29:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Then I used some program called 'Envy' and *everything* messed up.
2008-04-03T00:29:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,its a royal pain in the...
2008-04-03T00:29:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"It couldn't recognize my sound card, wireless card, or video card."
2008-04-03T00:29:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,wow... that sucks lol
2008-04-03T00:29:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,So that's when I did a clean install at 3 in the morning. T_T
2008-04-03T00:29:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"And 12 hours later, here I am. . ."
2008-04-03T00:29:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,oi.. thats too early lol
2008-04-03T00:30:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Doing another clean install, back to where I was two days ago."
2008-04-03T00:30:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,yupp
2008-04-03T00:34:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Once it finishes, do you have the time to run me through it again, from the beginning?"
2008-04-03T00:34:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Assuming everything will work properly?
2008-04-03T00:35:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,yea suere
2008-04-03T00:35:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,sure**
2008-04-03T00:35:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Okay, thanks. It shouldn't be so hard this time."
2008-04-03T00:35:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Just last night I transferred 4.5GB of books onto my laptop. . .
2008-04-03T00:35:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,It took nearly an hour.
2008-04-03T00:35:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,A few minutes later I realized I had to reinstall Ubuntu. T_T
2008-04-03T00:36:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Ubuntu can't mount that CD. =|
2008-04-03T00:36:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,4.5 gigs? psh.. try moving 25 gigs then reinstallin ubuntu lol

2008-04-03T00:36:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Wow, did that happen to you?"
2008-04-03T00:36:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,It's just .pdfs and .djvus -- math boks.
2008-04-03T00:37:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,yea it did happen to me lol
2008-04-03T00:37:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Ouch. =|
2008-04-03T00:37:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,yea.. just a little ouch tho
2008-04-03T00:37:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,but it only took me about an hour for all of it
2008-04-03T00:37:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Oh, wow."
2008-04-03T00:38:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,i hooked up the two comps via ccrossover cable
2008-04-03T00:38:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Oh, I see."
2008-04-03T00:38:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,worked pretty good actually lol
2008-04-03T00:38:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,I see.

2008-04-03T00:59:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,k install the cabextract and the ndiswrapper i told u to dl
2008-04-03T01:00:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,How? I don't want to mess anything up.
2008-04-03T01:00:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Extract the ndiswrapper to a folder in the Desktop, then run cabextract on it, right?"
2008-04-03T01:01:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"just extact the ndiswrapper folder on the desktop, which should make a new folder without the .tar.gz"
2008-04-03T01:01:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Right.
2008-04-03T01:01:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Now what is the command for cabextract?
2008-04-03T01:01:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,go into the cabextract folder by cd
2008-04-03T01:01:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,then sudo make
2008-04-03T01:01:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,then sudo make install
2008-04-03T01:02:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,yeah
2008-04-03T01:02:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"It's a .deb, so I just click on it and installed the package."
2008-04-03T01:02:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,oh yeah.. the cabextract its a deb so just click and it inslats
2008-04-03T01:02:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Right.
2008-04-03T01:03:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"then with ndiswrapper, put the tarball on ur desktop, right click, and click 'extract here'"
2008-04-03T01:03:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,then open a new terminal and type cd Desktop/ndiswrapper-1.52
2008-04-03T01:03:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Wait, wait, wait."
2008-04-03T01:03:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,lol sry
2008-04-03T01:03:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,I have the ndiswrapper-1.52 folder on the desktop.
2008-04-03T01:04:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"k, you extracted it right?"
2008-04-03T01:04:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Right.
2008-04-03T01:04:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,then in terminal: cd
2008-04-03T01:05:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"then, cd Desktop/ndiswrapper-1.52"
2008-04-03T01:05:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Okay, so I'm in the folder I just made on the desktop."
2008-04-03T01:06:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"okay, then type sudo make"
2008-04-03T01:06:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,This is the moment of truth. . .
2008-04-03T01:06:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,yea lol
2008-04-03T01:06:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,NO! Same thing!
2008-04-03T01:06:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,oi..
2008-04-03T01:07:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,where did u get ur livecd from?
2008-04-03T01:07:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,From the website.
2008-04-03T01:07:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,did you check it to see if it was corrupt or not?
2008-04-03T01:08:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Yes, I did."
2008-04-03T01:08:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,The CD had no errors.
2008-04-03T01:08:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,hmm.. i dunno then.. maybe something to do with ur laptop?
2008-04-03T01:08:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Okay, so let's run through what I did."
2008-04-03T01:08:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,I took the .tar.gz and extracted it to my Desktop.
2008-04-03T01:08:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,i ordered a couple cd's from ubuntu directly so ya
2008-04-03T01:08:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,That made a file called 'ndiswrapper-1.52.'
2008-04-03T01:09:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,okay
2008-04-03T01:09:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,I went to that file in terminal.
2008-04-03T01:09:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,And I did 'sudo make.'
2008-04-03T01:09:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Is that right?
2008-04-03T01:09:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,yeah
2008-04-03T01:09:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Make I need to do ./config or something?
2008-04-03T01:09:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Where does cabextract come in?
2008-04-03T01:09:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,nah..
2008-04-03T01:09:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,to extract the firmware from the driver you dl'd from hp
2008-04-03T01:11:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,yeah try that lol sudo apt-get build-dep ndiswrapper-common ndiswrapper-modules-1.9 ndiswrapper-utils-1.9
2008-04-03T01:12:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,iositd: 'E: You must put some 'source' in your sources.list'
2008-04-03T01:13:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,crap.. you need to have the ubuntu hooked up to the net for that
2008-04-03T01:13:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,is there any way you can get the ubuntu hooked up to the net thru an ethernet cable?
2008-04-03T01:14:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,you have to wait a minute for it to wrok
2008-04-03T01:15:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,is ur desktop comp windows?
2008-04-03T01:15:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"if anything, unplug ur desktop and plug that into ur ubuntu comp, and log onto irc from pidgin"
2008-04-03T01:18:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,yes
2008-04-03T01:19:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,from scratch.. unplug the cable from the desktop and plug it into ur laptop so that your laptop is connected to the router which is still connected to your modem
2008-04-03T01:19:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,make sure to log on to this via pidgin
2008-04-03T01:23:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,yup
2008-04-03T01:23:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,cool
2008-04-03T01:25:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,go into the package manager
2008-04-03T01:26:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,then clik settings repositories
2008-04-03T01:28:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,ill let iositd help you from here cuz he seems to know a lot more than i do about this stuff
2008-04-02T23:04:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,,"Doing 'sudo ndiswrapper -i bcmwl.inf' gies 'driver bcmwl5 is already instaleld', but it also says 'driver 'bcml5' is not instlaled (properly)!'"
2008-04-02T23:04:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,,How do I uninstall the driver and reinstall it?
2008-04-02T23:05:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,,How do I uninstall a driver?
2008-04-02T23:05:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,blacklist it
2008-04-02T23:05:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,How do I do that?
2008-04-02T23:06:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,then type the driver in there and save
2008-04-02T23:06:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,then restart
2008-04-02T23:06:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,So it opens up the text editor.
2008-04-02T23:07:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,I just save it? Without doing anything?
2008-04-02T23:07:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"no, write the name at the bottom of the list of the driver"
2008-04-02T23:07:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,then save
2008-04-02T23:08:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Okay, now I restart the computer?"
2008-04-02T23:08:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,FATAL: Module bcml5.inf not found.
2008-04-02T23:09:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,wait are you trying to remove a driver from ndiswrapper?
2008-04-02T23:09:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,ndiswrapper already installed a driver but it installed improperly.
2008-04-02T23:09:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,or are you trying to stop ndiswrapper all together? what are you trying to do in the first place?
2008-04-02T23:09:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,So I'm trying to *uninstall* the driver and reinstall it properly.
2008-04-02T23:10:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,then type this; sudo ndiswrapper -r <driver name>
2008-04-02T23:11:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,'couldn't delete /etc/ndiswrapper/bcmwl5.inf: No such file or directory'
2008-04-02T23:11:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,type ndiswrapper -L but lowercase L
2008-04-02T23:11:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,and paste the output
2008-04-02T23:11:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,type sudo ndiswrapper -r bcmwl5
2008-04-02T23:11:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,This is on another laptop.
2008-04-02T23:12:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,i was going thru the exact same thing you are
2008-04-02T23:12:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,you should just forget tryin to get ur bcm card to work and go get yourself a wireless bridge
2008-04-02T23:12:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Actually, I got it to work *perfectly* yesterday."
2008-04-02T23:13:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,But my sound and video card settings were thoroughly messed up so I installed a clean copy again.
2008-04-02T23:13:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"the problem with the bcm stuff is that it slowly 'decays', and sometimes quickly"
2008-04-02T23:13:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"it could be working perfectly for 10 mins or 10 hrs, then all of a sudden stop working all together"
2008-04-02T23:14:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"thats why i went with a wireless bridge lol, wayyyyyyyy easier to set up"
2008-04-02T23:14:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Well, it was working fine from about 12PM to 3AM yesterday."
2008-04-02T23:14:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,but it randomly stopped huh? mine did the same thing
2008-04-02T23:14:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,and i tried to get it working for like 3 months to no avail
2008-04-02T23:15:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,No.
2008-04-02T23:15:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,It was working fine.
2008-04-02T23:15:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,I just reinstalled Ubuntu.
2008-04-02T23:15:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,I reinstalled due to problems with my sound and video card.
2008-04-02T23:15:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"i reinstalled after i started having problems again with bcm, and i never got it working again"
2008-04-02T23:16:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Broadcom.
2008-04-02T23:16:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,One second.
2008-04-02T23:16:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,mines BCM4311MCG for example
2008-04-02T23:16:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Broadcom Corporation BCM4328 802.11a/b/g/n
2008-04-02T23:16:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,k gimme a few
2008-04-02T23:16:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,I think all I need to do is follow the 'INSTALL' in this ndiswrapper 1.52 tar.gz file.
2008-04-02T23:17:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,That's how I got it to work the first time.
2008-04-02T23:17:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,64 or 32-bit?
2008-04-02T23:17:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,32
2008-04-02T23:18:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,k gimme a few
2008-04-02T23:18:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,hey did you blacklist bcm43xx when you installed ndiswrapper?
2008-04-02T23:19:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Yes, I believe I did."
2008-04-02T23:19:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Sorry, can you paste the command to go to the blacklist again?"
2008-04-02T23:19:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,and also check ifthere is a # to the left of it
2008-04-02T23:20:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,There's a 'blacklist bcm43xx' above the 'blacklist bcmwl5'.
2008-04-02T23:20:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,You told me to do the second one.
2008-04-02T23:21:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"yea get rid of the bcmwl5 entry, i didn't know u were doin stuff with ndiswrapper"
2008-04-02T23:21:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,do you have a flash drive?
2008-04-02T23:21:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Okay.
2008-04-02T23:22:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Yes, I do. That's how I've been getting these files onto my laptop."
2008-04-02T23:22:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"k, if you could paste the output of ndiswrapper -l in a text document and transfer it to the machine ur on then pastebin it"
2008-04-02T23:22:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,How do I open the text editor for the blacklist?
2008-04-02T23:23:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,sudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
2008-04-02T23:23:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Okay, I saved that."
2008-04-02T23:23:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,ndiswrapper -l gives two things:
2008-04-02T23:24:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,sudo ndiswrapper -r bcmwl5
2008-04-02T23:24:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,then do ndiswrapper -l again
2008-04-02T23:24:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Okay, I did that."
2008-04-02T23:25:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,'bcmwl5 : invalid driver!'
2008-04-02T23:25:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Only once this time.
2008-04-02T23:25:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,then do the sudo ndiswrapper -r bcmwl5 again
2008-04-02T23:26:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,'couldn't delete /etc/ndiswrapper/bcmwl5: No such file or directory'
2008-04-02T23:26:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,'bcmwl5 : invalid driver!'
2008-04-02T23:26:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"okay, ill give you a link to downoad a good driver, gimme a second"
2008-04-02T23:27:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Okay.
2008-04-02T23:28:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,wut kinda computer is it?
2008-04-02T23:29:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,HP dv6000
2008-04-02T23:32:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,go to this page and download the file at the bottom: http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?softwareitem=ob-53245-1&lc=en&cc=us&lang=en&os=228&product=1842155&dlc=en

2008-04-02T23:33:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,yeah
2008-04-02T23:34:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,then u gotta get the drivers and firmware out of it with cabextract
2008-04-02T23:34:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,It's an .exe. Where do I install it?
2008-04-02T23:34:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Okay.
2008-04-02T23:34:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,gimme a sec ill find it for ya
2008-04-02T23:35:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,http://packages.ubuntu.com/feisty/utils/cabextract and click the i386 one
2008-04-02T23:36:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,lemme know when you have both of those downloaded
2008-04-02T23:36:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Okay.
2008-04-02T23:36:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"So this will get rid of the invalid 'bcmwl5,' too?"
2008-04-02T23:37:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,we're gonna reinstall the drivers
2008-04-02T23:37:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Okay, but ndiswrapper -l still gives the 'bcmwl5 : invalid driver!' right?"
2008-04-02T23:37:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,for now
2008-04-02T23:38:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Okay, just making sure."
2008-04-02T23:39:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Okay, I've just installed 'cabextract.'"
2008-04-02T23:39:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,What do I do now?
2008-04-02T23:39:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,now make a folder called ndiswrapper on ur desktop
2008-04-02T23:39:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Okay.
2008-04-02T23:40:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,and put the sp36684.exe file in there
2008-04-02T23:40:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Okay.
2008-04-02T23:41:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Okay.
2008-04-02T23:41:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,just to make sure sudo ndiswrapper -r bcmwl5 again
2008-04-02T23:42:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,'couldn't delete /etc/ndiswrapper/bcmwl5: No such file or directory'
2008-04-02T23:43:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"okay, then sudo ndiswrapper -i bcmwl5.inf"
2008-04-02T23:43:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,'installing bcmwl5. . .'

2008-04-02T23:44:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,crap i skipped a whole step lol sorry
2008-04-02T23:44:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Yes, the .exe is in the 'ndiswrapper' folder in the Dekstop."
2008-04-02T23:44:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Oh, okay."
2008-04-02T23:44:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"cd in terminal, then cd Desktop/ndswrapper"
2008-04-02T23:44:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,I already did that.
2008-04-02T23:45:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,'
2008-04-02T23:45:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,k then sudo ndiswrapper -i bcmwl5.inf
2008-04-02T23:46:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,driver bcmwl5 is already installed
2008-04-02T23:46:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,ndiswrapper -v
2008-04-02T23:46:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,utils version: 1.9

2008-04-02T23:47:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,That's what 'ndiswrapper -v' gave me.
2008-04-02T23:47:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,ur ndiswrapper isn't installed right..
2008-04-02T23:47:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Oh.
2008-04-02T23:47:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,How do I install it properly?
2008-04-02T23:48:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"wow, thats where all these problems are coming from lol, h/o lemme find somethin for ya"
2008-04-02T23:48:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Haha, okay."
2008-04-02T23:49:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=93482 and download the stable version
2008-04-02T23:50:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,I already have this on my flash drive.
2008-04-02T23:51:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"okay, then gimme one sec.."
2008-04-02T23:52:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,get that folder onto ur comp and cd into it from terminal
2008-04-02T23:53:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Okay, done."
2008-04-02T23:53:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,so ur in the ndiswrapper-1.52 folder right? type sudo make
2008-04-02T23:54:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,That gives *a lot* of errors and warnings.
2008-04-02T23:54:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Most of them start with 'loadndisdriver.c:'
2008-04-02T23:55:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,what when u run make?
2008-04-02T23:55:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,yes.
2008-04-02T23:55:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"hmm.. try a different ndiswrapper file, sounds like that one is missing stuff"
2008-04-02T23:56:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Or, I think my computer is missing some header files or something."
2008-04-02T23:56:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,I think all of them are errors that have to do with the C.
2008-04-02T23:57:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"hmm.. yeah, this is why i gave up on my broadcom card lol"
2008-04-02T23:57:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,A bunch of 'undeclared's and 'implicit declaration's.
2008-04-02T23:57:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"No, I think it has something to do with the Linux kernel itself -- it just cannot recognize the C code or something."
2008-04-02T23:57:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"ill try to find u this really good tutorial i used before, but you'll have to do another couple things before using it"
2008-04-02T23:57:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,paste them
2008-04-02T23:58:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,ill look at them to see wut i can get from it
2008-04-02T23:58:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Where do I put it in Ubuntu?
2008-04-02T23:58:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,A text editor or something?
2008-04-02T23:58:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,yeah
2008-04-02T23:58:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Can Windows recognize it?
2008-04-02T23:58:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,if you open the file from wordpad
2008-04-02T23:59:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Okay, I pasted it into gedit."
2008-04-02T23:59:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,now save the file and ya
2008-04-02T23:59:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,there's a way to save it as .txt but i forgot
2008-04-03T00:01:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,I saved it into my traveldrive but it's not showing up when I plug it into the desktop. . .
2008-04-03T00:02:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"create a .txt file on ur desktop, put it in the drive, then paste the stuff in that file in ubuntu, then back again"
2008-04-03T00:02:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,too complicated lol
2008-04-03T00:02:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Okay. T_T
2008-04-03T00:03:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Okay, I did that, but when I put it into the desktop and open the file, nothing shows up. . ."
2008-04-03T00:04:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,This is like playing 'Whack the Gopher.'
2008-04-03T00:04:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"lol it really is, i remember going back and forth between two laptops, one ubuntu and one windows, until i figured out how to do file sharing lol"
2008-04-03T00:05:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Okay, I got it to work, but it is all bunched up. . ."
2008-04-03T00:05:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"copy and paste it into pastebin, sometimes that fixes the formatting issues"
2008-04-03T00:06:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Oh, right."
2008-04-03T00:06:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,http://pastebin.com/m42f7166
2008-04-03T00:07:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,those files are just missing.. thats all don't worry about ur ubuntu install
2008-04-03T00:07:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Oh, okay."
2008-04-03T00:07:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,So should I reinstall from sourceforge?
2008-04-03T00:07:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"yeah, have u tried using the restricted drivers yet?"
2008-04-03T00:08:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,The only thing in my restricted drivers is the NVIDIA soundcard.
2008-04-03T00:08:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,*video card
2008-04-03T00:08:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,really? hmm.. so u kinda got no choice but to use ndiswrapper
2008-04-03T00:08:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Right. T_T
2008-04-03T00:09:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"first, go into synaptic package manager and uninstall all the ndiswrapper stuff.. ALL of it.."
2008-04-03T00:09:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,the sourceforge dist should be enough
2008-04-03T00:11:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"I said 'completely remove' for both 'ndiswrapper-utils' and 'ndiswrapper-common,' but the error is: 'E: bcm43xx-fwcutter: subprocess post-installation script returned error exit status 1'"
2008-04-03T00:15:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,have u reinstalled ndiswrapper yet?
2008-04-03T00:15:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,'E: bcm43xx-fwcutter: subprocess post-installation script returned error exit status 1'
2008-04-03T00:15:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,whats wrong with ur comp lol
2008-04-03T00:15:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,That's what I go when I tried to completely remove ndiswrapper-common and ndiswrapper-utils.
2008-04-03T00:15:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,yeah.. i have no idea lol
2008-04-03T00:16:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,i never had to deal with any of that
2008-04-03T00:16:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,It's time to Google. =D
2008-04-03T00:16:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Or, it only takes about 20 minutes to clean install."
2008-04-03T00:16:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,yeah it really is lol. my best suggestion to keep you from having any more headaches is to spend $20 on a wireless bridge
2008-04-03T00:16:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,they're really easy to set up
2008-04-03T00:17:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Will I have to go through this ndiswrapper stuff?
2008-04-03T00:17:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,with a wireless bridge? no
2008-04-03T00:17:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,I'll take a look at it.
2008-04-03T00:18:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"to set up a wireless bridge, all you do is set a static ip on ur 'wired connection' in ubuntu, type the ip of the bridge in firefox, and go from there"
2008-04-03T00:18:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"its really, really,really simple"
2008-04-03T00:18:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Hm. But for now, I'll have to get this working."
2008-04-03T00:18:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,no money im guessin lol
2008-04-03T00:19:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,And no time. =D
2008-04-03T00:19:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,it takes alot less time to set up a bridge
2008-04-03T00:19:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,took me five minutes
2008-04-03T00:19:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Can I get one at Circuit City?
2008-04-03T00:20:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,And will the connection be stable?
2008-04-03T00:20:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"yes you can get them at circuit city and yes they're stable, thats how im talkin to ya lol"
2008-04-03T00:20:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Haha, okay. And they are only $20?"
2008-04-03T00:20:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"about that, maybe cheaper"
2008-04-03T00:21:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Sounds great. I'll research them and hopefully I'll be able to get one today.
2008-04-03T00:21:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,ill find u somethin right now lol
2008-04-03T00:22:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"The thing is, I had a very stable (95%+) reception yesterday. . ."
2008-04-03T00:22:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Do you know how I can purge bcm43xx-fwcutter, maybe?"
2008-04-03T00:23:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,no lol.
2008-04-03T00:23:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,u gotta walmart near u?
2008-04-03T00:23:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Yes.
2008-04-03T00:23:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,yeah.. they're cheaper than circuit city lol
2008-04-03T00:24:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,But I don't know if it is *necessary.* I had the wireless connection set up manually and I made it my default and it worked like a charm.
2008-04-03T00:25:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"once my broadcom worked i was happy, but then it stopped working completely, and i haven't gotten it to wrok since"
2008-04-03T00:25:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Okay, I'm going to do a clean install again -- I've already messed with ndiswrapper and the drivers."
2008-04-03T00:25:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Hm, I see."
2008-04-03T00:26:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"yupp,, broadcom is just too much of a headache imo"
2008-04-03T00:26:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,I can't imagine Linux is really friendly to people who actually have things to do.
2008-04-03T00:27:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,it is if you have the right equipment lol
2008-04-03T00:27:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,But I'm a poor N00B. =|
2008-04-03T00:27:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"i like it, just yeah.. it does take alotta time to get it working and stuff"
2008-04-03T00:27:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,im just as much of a noob lol
2008-04-03T00:28:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"At one point yesterday, I had wireless, my screen resolution, sound, *and* Compiz working."
2008-04-03T00:28:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,AND I had my text-based IM client working.
2008-04-03T00:28:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,It was absolutely amazing.
2008-04-03T00:28:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Then I had wanted to make my resolution the default setting.
2008-04-03T00:28:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"yeah it is pretty amazing, i got all of that right now lol"
2008-04-03T00:28:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,So I did something with the NVIDIA-settings.
2008-04-03T00:28:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,i even got the desktop cube thing working. .its really cool lol
2008-04-03T00:28:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Then I lost sound. So I did some stuff at restarted.
2008-04-03T00:28:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Yes, I had nearly every single extra setting on. :D"
2008-04-03T00:29:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,I got sound back but my graphics was still not working.
2008-04-03T00:29:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Then I used some program called 'Envy' and *everything* messed up.
2008-04-03T00:29:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,its a royal pain in the...
2008-04-03T00:29:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"It couldn't recognize my sound card, wireless card, or video card."
2008-04-03T00:29:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,wow... that sucks lol
2008-04-03T00:29:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,So that's when I did a clean install at 3 in the morning. T_T
2008-04-03T00:29:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"And 12 hours later, here I am. . ."
2008-04-03T00:29:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,oi.. thats too early lol
2008-04-03T00:30:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Doing another clean install, back to where I was two days ago."
2008-04-03T00:30:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,yupp
2008-04-03T00:34:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Once it finishes, do you have the time to run me through it again, from the beginning?"
2008-04-03T00:34:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Assuming everything will work properly?
2008-04-03T00:35:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,yea suere
2008-04-03T00:35:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,sure**
2008-04-03T00:35:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Okay, thanks. It shouldn't be so hard this time."
2008-04-03T00:35:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Just last night I transferred 4.5GB of books onto my laptop. . .
2008-04-03T00:35:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,It took nearly an hour.
2008-04-03T00:35:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,A few minutes later I realized I had to reinstall Ubuntu. T_T
2008-04-03T00:36:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Ubuntu can't mount that CD. =|

2008-04-03T01:01:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"just extact the ndiswrapper folder on the desktop, which should make a new folder without the .tar.gz"
2008-04-03T01:01:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Right.
2008-04-03T01:01:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Now what is the command for cabextract?

2008-04-03T01:05:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Okay, so I'm in the folder I just made on the desktop."
2008-04-03T01:06:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,"okay, then type sudo make"
2008-04-03T01:06:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,This is the moment of truth. . .
2008-04-03T01:06:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,yea lol

2008-04-03T01:07:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,did you check it to see if it was corrupt or not?
2008-04-03T01:08:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Yes, I did."
2008-04-03T01:08:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,The CD had no errors.
2008-04-03T01:08:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,hmm.. i dunno then.. maybe something to do with ur laptop?
2008-04-03T01:08:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,"Okay, so let's run through what I did."
2008-04-03T01:08:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,I took the .tar.gz and extracted it to my Desktop.
2008-04-03T01:08:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,i ordered a couple cd's from ubuntu directly so ya
2008-04-03T01:08:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,That made a file called 'ndiswrapper-1.52.'
2008-04-03T01:09:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,okay
2008-04-03T01:09:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,I went to that file in terminal.
2008-04-03T01:09:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,And I did 'sudo make.'
2008-04-03T01:09:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,Is that right?
2008-04-03T01:09:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,yeah

2008-04-03T01:12:00.000Z,ChaosTheory,billy,iositd: 'E: You must put some 'source' in your sources.list'
2008-04-03T01:13:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,crap.. you need to have the ubuntu hooked up to the net for that
2008-04-03T01:13:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,is there any way you can get the ubuntu hooked up to the net thru an ethernet cable?
2008-04-03T01:14:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,you have to wait a minute for it to wrok

2008-04-03T01:19:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,from scratch.. unplug the cable from the desktop and plug it into ur laptop so that your laptop is connected to the router which is still connected to your modem
2008-04-03T01:19:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,make sure to log on to this via pidgin
2008-04-03T01:23:00.000Z,billy,ChaosTheory,yup
