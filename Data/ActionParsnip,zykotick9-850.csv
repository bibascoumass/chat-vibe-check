2011-07-29T10:03:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,thanks.  That apt-get line you just gave is obviously editing /etc/apt/apt.conf - that might come in handy for me.

2012-10-05T03:05:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,there are some older ones I guess but the newer stuff is in /var/log/dpkg.log

2012-10-05T03:07:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,"doh, perhaps zcat is failing on the non-gz file :(  forget my previous idea!"

2012-10-19T09:36:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,you can run compiz on its own

2012-10-19T09:37:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,"course it is, it draws and manages the Windows. Its a WM"
2012-10-19T09:38:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,with a little tweaking (making a new session for lightdm) you can run compiz without a DE
2012-10-19T09:38:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,"most people can't run 'compiz' by itself.  openbox/fluxbox/awesome/etc are WM that you can run by themselves, without a DE."
2012-10-19T09:38:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,"they can, they just need to make a session"
2012-10-19T09:39:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,"compiz is HIGH cpu usage, all other WM are not...???"
2012-10-19T09:39:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,that doesn't mean it cannot run on it's own just like openbox etc
2012-10-19T09:40:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,"honestly, i'm finding it difficult to even picture compiz without nautils, or any other WM...  but i guess, because you are saying it, that's it's possible - and i'm wrong.  my bad."
2012-10-19T09:41:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,you can run nautilus. You will simply need to add the --no-desktop option
2012-10-19T09:41:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,"or, what I do, use pcmanfm and tell nautilus to not  draw desktop icons, makes a snappier OS"

2012-06-15T02:47:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,"load is 100% cpu measurement.  did you know - % of CPU utilization is actually a measurement of time?  cause a cpu is either 0 or 1, that's it."
2012-06-15T02:49:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,of the cpu
2012-06-15T02:50:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,so load 1 = no process waiting in cue

2012-06-16T05:52:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,"well i can say that ^ works for sure, beyond that - you'd have to test ;)"
2012-06-16T05:52:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,could always run:  apt-cache search . | grep '^dove'

2012-07-01T04:52:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,n64 is 6 GBP...
2012-07-01T04:53:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,check out the prices for new n64 games.  i own a boxed copy of 'Pocky & Rocky 2' that i got from a 2nd hand thrift sort for nothing - and it's probably worth $500+ ;) </OT>
2012-07-01T04:54:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,sorry Pocky & Rocky 2 is an SNES game
2012-07-02T00:38:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,does it upload to ubuntuone and stuff?
2012-07-02T00:38:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,no.  unless you put it's directory in a sync folder.

2012-08-03T03:59:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,maybe a bad route?
2012-08-03T03:59:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,could be??

2012-08-03T04:36:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,indeed :)
2012-08-03T04:37:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,thanks ;)  [just confirming]
2012-08-03T04:37:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,no bad thing
2012-08-07T02:52:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,"technically, server (without gui) is more responsive then lubuntu ;)"

2012-08-07T02:53:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,agreed
2012-08-12T04:23:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,once its released it's officially stable :)

2012-08-15T03:22:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,i don't.  / and * work for me ;)
2012-08-15T05:01:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,so can any distro...
2012-08-16T03:14:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,you'd probably need an electro-magnet to actually wipe a drive...
2012-08-16T03:14:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,I've used a strong fridge magnet in the past. I've been in the same place.Works well
2012-08-16T03:15:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,good to know (i guess). of the potential danger ;)
2012-08-16T03:16:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,hence 'last ditch' ;)
2012-08-18T03:36:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,"it's the installing new, that usually causes 'update' not to update everything..."
2012-09-01T01:36:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,why not?
2012-09-01T01:36:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,"ahh, then it's ok on 32bit ubuntu :)"
2012-09-01T01:36:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,is 32bit not multiarch?
2012-09-01T01:37:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,well it'll be only 32bit if the kernel is 32bit
2012-09-02T01:29:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,my 'history' and my ~/.bash_history don't match??? odd.
2012-09-04T02:21:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,"using resolv.conf is only a temporary solution, a reboot will probably set that back to previous settings (due to N-M in 12.04 - resolv.conf is deprecated) :|"
2012-09-04T02:21:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,updates may fix things
2012-09-04T02:23:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,i'm not refering to the original issue - on that your probably right (i have 0 idea)... i was just mentioning that resolv.conf is no longer a good answer for things... :(
2012-09-04T04:46:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,thats the bsd standard ;). Linu standard is 'ps -ef'
2012-09-04T04:47:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,"agreed. but 'ps -aux' says 'Warning: bad ps syntax, perhaps a bogus '-'?'"

2012-09-18T03:45:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,no harm done. its a custom kernel anyway so not supported here
2012-09-18T03:46:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,i still agree with that ;) [what's in backports?  that should be supported.  squeeze (what lucid is based off of) does have a 3.2 in debian backports]

2012-10-05T04:38:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,back to front is mor pc
2012-10-05T04:51:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,errors to /dev/null nice ;)
2012-10-05T04:51:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,"actually, that's output?!?"
2012-10-05T04:51:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,"tee outputs to the stdout as well as the file, its just neater"
2012-10-05T04:52:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,"nice.  tee is something i know 'almost' nothing about, excupt when you want sudo redirection you NEED to use it ;)"
2012-10-05T04:53:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,"tee will put the text in the file on it's own (similar to >)  tee -a adds to the file, like >>"
2012-10-05T04:54:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,i know what tee is.  i've just never come across a 'use case' myself ;)  thanks man!
2012-10-05T04:55:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,"ahh, its because sudo doesn't rraverse redirection. I use it a lot"
2012-10-05T04:55:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,i loved the timing of my pm vs your public statement ;) hilarious
2012-10-05T04:56:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,zing
2012-10-05T05:34:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,"i'd say 'ps aux' is both BSD/Unix is standard.  isn't gnu/linux a unix-like OS?  [AP, not for you] NOTE: it's 'ps aux' not 'ps -aux' (see 1st line error message if you use this)"
2012-10-05T05:36:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,the man page outlines it all :)
2012-10-05T05:36:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,ssh / i forget / man ftw now ;)
2012-10-05T05:36:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,or the man bang in ddg :)
2012-10-11T16:54:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,"i don't ever remember using ar before, i was wondering if that was a typo.  thanks.  always good to learn a new command."
2012-10-11T16:55:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,"unp may do it too, unp is amazing"
2012-10-19T02:29:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,"could use xfce, its coded using gtk"
2012-10-19T02:30:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,"i use xfce for both my, and my mom's, HTPCs ;).  but for desktop - it's not gnome2 ;)"
2012-10-19T02:32:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,similar in look and feel
2012-10-19T02:32:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,xfce is a bad gnome2 - i agree.  they are similar ;)
2012-10-19T09:35:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,compiz is lighter then razorqt?
2012-10-19T09:36:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,"you can't run compiz (the wm) by itself, other WM you can."
2012-10-19T09:36:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,you can run compiz on its own
2012-10-19T09:36:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-gpIKG6RX4
2012-10-19T09:36:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,"while i 100% agree with you, compiz is a WM.  i don't consider compiz a WM ;)"
2012-10-19T09:37:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,"course it is, it draws and manages the Windows. Its a WM"
2012-10-19T09:38:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,with a little tweaking (making a new session for lightdm) you can run compiz without a DE
2012-10-19T09:38:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,"most people can't run 'compiz' by itself.  openbox/fluxbox/awesome/etc are WM that you can run by themselves, without a DE."
2012-10-19T09:38:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,"they can, they just need to make a session"
2012-10-19T09:39:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,"compiz is HIGH cpu usage, all other WM are not...???"
2012-10-19T09:39:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,that doesn't mean it cannot run on it's own just like openbox etc
2012-10-19T09:40:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,"honestly, i'm finding it difficult to even picture compiz without nautils, or any other WM...  but i guess, because you are saying it, that's it's possible - and i'm wrong.  my bad."
2012-10-19T09:41:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,you can run nautilus. You will simply need to add the --no-desktop option
2012-10-19T09:41:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,"or, what I do, use pcmanfm and tell nautilus to not  draw desktop icons, makes a snappier OS"
2012-10-21T03:29:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,i headr someone say it was windows key for them a few days back
2012-10-21T03:29:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,"it is, on my awesome windows manager ;)  but 'I' didn't say it."
2012-10-21T03:30:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,gah
2012-10-21T04:37:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,and amd64 cpu can run both 32&64 bit ;)
2012-10-21T05:23:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,agree 100%
2012-10-21T05:22:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,"its a tonne easier, fewer issues and no fluff from the old installs"
2012-10-21T05:24:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,all i have to say in reply.  that was a very good answer.
2012-10-21T05:25:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,development = release right now correct?  you must miss +1.  ;)
2012-10-21T05:26:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,I'm masochistic like that :). Plus my hardware is super linux friendly
2012-10-21T05:26:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,+1 on gnu/linux friendly h/w
2012-10-21T05:29:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,"its not fast, but it works :)"

2012-10-21T07:48:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,do you want me to answer 'why not' -- i don't think so.... why ask?
2012-10-21T07:49:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,was aimed at apoplectic
2012-10-21T07:49:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,thanks.  i just learned a new word!
2012-10-21T08:09:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,ubuntu+lightdm+xorg+openbox?
2012-10-21T08:09:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,"lightdm is a nice to have, I'd go for slim for lightness :)"
2012-10-21T08:09:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,"lol, as would i.  but i wouldn't recommend slim to anyone in #ubuntu"
2012-10-21T08:19:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,did yo see Eben Moglen's interviews on /. the last two days?  he calls chrome by a different name ;)
2012-10-21T08:20:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,who is 'Eben Moglen'?
2012-10-21T08:21:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,doesn't matter.  (actually he's a better representative of the 'free' software movement then RMS)
2012-10-21T08:21:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,i don't listen toall the politics stuff that goes into linux. I just get on with using it
2012-10-21T08:22:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,i know.  that i can see repect you in the morning ;)
2012-10-21T08:22:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,hehe
2012-10-21T08:23:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,s/that/and/ ;)
2012-11-02T06:02:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,"i just found out yesterday that you can theme midnight-commander, not that i have ;)"
2012-11-02T06:02:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,nice :)
2012-11-06T02:03:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,while i agree 'all software has bugs' i wouldn't say 'all software is buggy' ;)
2012-11-07T11:23:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,I'd just reinstall too
2012-11-15T04:51:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,i believe the term is 'final' not stable...
2012-11-15T04:52:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,yourwitness :)
2012-11-15T04:52:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,"ummm, my bad."
2012-11-16T22:36:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,i liked your skype is 32bit prof pastebin myself :)
2012-11-16T23:22:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,unless it's an ssd drive ext2 is a questionable choice.  no journalling.
2012-11-16T23:22:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,"yes, so the wear will be less due to no journal updates"
2012-11-16T23:23:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,"true.  which is good for ssd drives, but you get a less stable filesystem..."
2012-11-16T23:23:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,true but it can be used :)
2012-11-16T23:23:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,you need 'lspci -v | grep -i vga' to see both hybrid cards!  voldyman_
2012-11-29T23:20:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,"thanks for the ddg !ubottu bang, will be using that!"
2012-11-29T23:21:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,"try some, see what happens. You can't break anything :)"
2012-11-29T23:21:00.000Z,zykotick9,ActionParsnip,honestly i use !i and !g too much :(
2012-11-29T23:21:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,https://duckduckgo.com/bang.html     look at them all :)
2012-11-29T23:24:00.000Z,ActionParsnip,zykotick9,could try: !gisafeoff search     to :)
