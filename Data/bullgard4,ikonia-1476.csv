2007-07-13T08:20:00.000Z,bullgard4,,My computer stores about 40 files containing 'hwmon' in their names. What is the meaning of 'hwmon'?
2007-07-13T08:20:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,at a guess 'hardware monitor' logs
2007-07-13T08:20:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,What do you mean with 'hardware monitor logs'?
2007-07-30T13:38:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,you can upload it to launchpad with the repot a bug option
2007-07-30T13:39:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"I do not understand your phrase 'with the repot a bug option'. Say it in other words, please."
2007-07-30T13:39:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,launchpad allows you to upload docs when you report a bug
2007-07-30T13:40:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,And where will the docs be stored? How can I store those documents?
2007-07-30T13:41:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I will try it again.
2007-09-12T06:50:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,just name
2007-09-12T06:50:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,hm
2007-11-22T21:39:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,what probem
2007-11-28T01:33:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,can you tell me your question please as I missed it
2007-11-28T01:35:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia, Why does getty start so late? (In  http://www.bootchart.org/images/bootchart.debian.mcrae.0.png 38 seconds after INIT) I thought it only depends on INIT.
2007-11-28T01:37:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"getty should only need the network stack up, nothing else, I think its started last as its an ancillery application rather than a core service"
2007-11-28T01:38:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,if you look at that chart you'll see core services are started first so that looks like a selection choice rather than technical dependency as that is only the tcp stack
2007-11-28T01:38:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,ompaul does that make sense to you ?
2007-11-28T01:39:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I need longer time to think about your statement. Thank you very much for commenting.
2007-11-28T01:40:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"here is other food for thought. getty is launched off init, init is the first thing thats launched so what you 'may' be seeing in your image is getty is spawned by init but not actually 'started' until you login which is why your chart is showing it last"
2007-11-28T01:40:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,it depends how that chart is made I guess
2007-11-28T01:40:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,just more food for thought
2007-11-28T01:48:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I disagree with that 'it depends how that chart is made'. My laptop computer shows a similar behaviour. I would like to find out why. This situation is independent of the way a start diagram is drawn. --  I do not think that getty is starting only after my login.
2007-11-29T22:33:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"why argue,"
2007-11-30T15:27:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,differentiate between kernel and xorg modules ?
2007-11-30T15:28:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I do not understand your question. There is a subject missing in it.
2007-11-30T15:29:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"you asked why differentiate between xorg and kernel modules, I'm asking you what you mean"
2007-11-30T15:29:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I was referring to jrib's message.
2007-11-30T16:53:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,this is ubuntu support only. Please ask only ubuntu support related questions
2007-11-30T16:53:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,This is Ubuntu related.
2007-11-30T16:53:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"no its not, this is ubuntu operating system support"
2007-11-30T16:56:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,different hardware
2007-11-30T16:56:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Your message is not helpful.
2007-11-30T16:56:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,it's the answer
2007-11-30T16:57:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,they are different hardware so will require different dection and boot options
2007-12-03T16:34:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,it means that process is in a stopped state
2007-12-03T16:35:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Why is this fact not expressed much simpler with '<process name> stopped'?
2007-12-03T16:36:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"its just 3 letters on the end, its expressed clearly enough"
2007-12-03T16:36:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Thank you for commenting.
2007-12-04T21:54:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,did you tell it to ?
2007-12-04T21:54:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"Yes, I think so."
2008-01-04T03:04:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,the last number is just the ubuntu build number
2008-01-04T03:05:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Thank you for explaining.
2008-01-15T20:33:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Your remark is not helpful.
2008-01-15T20:32:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"if you have to ask, yo ushould NOT be building a kernel"
2008-01-15T20:33:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,it's advice
2008-01-15T20:33:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,I stronglly suggest you consider it
2008-01-15T20:33:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Your remark is not helpful.
2008-01-15T20:33:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"it  is advice for you ro listen to, or ignore"
2008-01-16T17:17:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,X and framebuffer are two different technologies
2008-01-16T17:19:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Yes. But this does not explain that the consoles use only a part of my screen area.
2008-01-16T17:19:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,I do'nt understand your question
2008-01-16T17:20:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Please tell me what part of my question you do not understand. Or do you want me to repeat the whole message?
2008-01-16T17:21:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,your terminals and framebuffer ?
2008-01-16T17:23:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Your question is too short to be understandable for me. Please put your question in a whole sentence.
2008-01-16T17:23:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,I don't understand how your asking about framebuffers and terminals - they are totally differnt things
2008-01-16T17:24:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I am asking why my consoles do not fill the whole screen area and do not display 80 lines as directed.
2008-01-18T18:09:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,there isn't one
2008-01-18T18:10:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,What is the reason for such a situation?
2008-01-18T18:10:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,there is no such thing as a kernel command line
2008-01-18T18:10:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"you can pass kernel boot options/arugments if you want, is that what you mean"
2008-01-18T18:11:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"You are wrong. You can google for 'kernel command line', and you will find very many hits."
2008-01-18T18:11:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,no I'm not
2008-01-18T18:11:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,READ the hits that say 'kernel command line'
2008-01-18T18:12:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I am not sure that a kernel command line is defined as a variable that accespts kernel boot options.
2008-01-18T18:13:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,it is
2008-01-18T18:13:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,the kernel command line is what people are calling the boot options you can pass to the kernel
2008-01-18T18:14:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"I hear your statement. I am going to prove it. --  Thank you for your comments, anyway."
2008-01-18T18:14:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,there is nothing to prove
2008-01-18T18:15:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Why is there nothing to prove? In what respect?
2008-01-18T18:16:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"1.) there is no kernel 'command line' the options people are refering to in the links you say in google are the boot parameters passed through grub that people are calling a command line. That is not the correct name, but that is what they are calling it in the links you reference"
2008-01-18T18:18:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"I have got the feeling that you are right with your last statement, and I will make this to my base assumption. If I will encounter contradictions to that, I will do further resarch. --  Thank you very much."
2008-01-21T18:36:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,it's a sound card 'high def audio'
2008-01-21T18:37:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Thank you.
2008-01-28T19:00:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,no
2008-01-31T15:31:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,no-one has packaged it
2008-01-31T15:31:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,it's that simple
2008-02-13T21:32:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,there is no manual
2008-02-13T21:33:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,why are you trying to build a kernel
2008-02-13T21:34:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I am not going to build a kernel now. I am going to learn and understand before I go to compile my own kernel.
2008-02-13T21:34:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"why do you want to build a kernel, it will break your ubuntu package manager and dependant packages"
2008-02-13T21:36:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Let me repeat: ' ikonia: I am not going to build a kernel now. '
2008-02-13T21:36:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,let me repeat 'why do you want to build a kernel'
2008-02-13T21:37:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"No, I do not want to build a kernel. I would like to know how 'make menuconfig' functions or operates."
2008-02-13T21:38:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,it builds an ncruses interface to write a .config file.
2008-02-13T21:38:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Thank you for your information.
2008-02-13T22:57:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,doesn't matter what directory it's in
2008-02-13T23:00:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,May I object. It matters. I'd like to retrieve it even at a later date when I already forgot all details of my download. I'd like to do it as the more experienced users do in order to keep my Ubuntu lucid.
2008-02-13T23:00:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,where you place the source package or untar it - doesn't matter
2008-02-13T23:00:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,fact
2008-02-13T23:01:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Right. Then I will place it in  /usr/src/linux/debian/ .
2008-02-13T23:01:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"if you want to,"
2008-02-13T23:02:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Thank you for commenting.
2008-03-20T15:32:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,they are different files
2008-03-20T15:32:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,package file cache and source package fil ecache
2008-03-20T15:32:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,What is their difference?
2008-03-20T15:33:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,one is for packages one os fir source packages
2008-03-20T15:33:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,What is the difference between 'packages' and 'source packages'?
2008-03-20T15:34:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,packages and compiles source packages are the source packages used to be packages
2008-03-28T12:35:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,what are you talking about
2008-03-28T12:36:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I am talking about what I wrote.
2008-03-28T12:36:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"yes, but it doesnt make sense"
2008-03-28T12:37:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Please elaborate.
2008-03-28T12:37:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,the problem your describing doesn't make sense
2008-03-28T12:38:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,It must be your sense which cannot make it out. I have already got a response that found my question intelligible.
2008-03-28T12:39:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,your asking may you shut down a database service ?
2008-03-28T12:40:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,yes.
2008-03-28T12:44:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Please read more carefully. I mentioned the database: It is mysql.
2008-03-28T12:46:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,thats not a database
2008-03-28T12:46:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,the databases are that mysql is hosting
2008-03-28T12:47:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,so don't tell me to 'read more carefully'
2008-03-28T12:49:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"Wikipedia: 'MySQL (pronounced /maɪˌɛskjuːˈɛl/) is a multithreaded, multi-user SQL database management system.'"
2008-03-28T12:50:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,correct - so it's not a database
2008-03-28T12:50:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,hence why I'm telling you that shutting down the mysql service may cause you issues if it's hosting a database that something wants
2008-03-28T12:51:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Tautology.
2008-03-28T12:51:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,pardon ?
2008-03-28T12:52:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,why are you arguing this with me ???? I'm trying to offer you advise that will stop you having problems ???? you've had a history of not asking questions clearly I was just asking you to clarify what your asking
2008-03-30T01:14:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,why - he's running 7.10 - not 8.04
2008-03-31T12:12:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,can you do a dpkg -c on the package ?
2008-03-31T12:15:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,'detlef@MD97600:~$ LANG=C dpkg -c /usr/share/doc/gnome-system-tools/; dpkg-deb: error reading version number from file /usr/share/doc/gnome-system-tools/: Is a directory.'
2008-04-07T17:48:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"many applications need different versions, subversion is a good example"
2008-04-07T17:53:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Do the Berkeley database versions differ so much that applications can only use a certain Berkeley database version? Are Berkeley databases a very new development?
2008-04-14T16:48:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,gpm can do cut and paste out of the box
2008-04-14T16:49:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,gpm = General Purpose Mouse Interface?
2008-04-14T16:49:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,thats it
2008-04-15T15:59:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,english only please.

2008-04-17T16:12:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,there is a quick summary http://www.ubuntu.com/GetUbuntu/releasenotes/710
2008-04-17T16:16:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Excuse me. I made a typing error. I should have written: 'Can you recommend a comprehensive listing of the Gutsy changes towards Hardy?'
2008-04-17T16:16:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"same thing, change log"
2008-04-17T16:17:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardyHeron/Beta/
2008-04-17T16:18:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Thank you.
2008-04-24T19:41:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,source files can go where you want
2008-04-24T19:44:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Unification is a valuable asset in software production and usage. It is a waste to not unify a location for source code files in Linux and Ubuntu.
2008-04-24T19:44:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"ok, 'there isn't an official location'"
2008-04-24T19:45:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Ok. I notice. -- Thank you.
2008-04-24T19:45:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,no problem
2008-04-25T13:13:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,ask debian guys
2008-04-25T13:14:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Debian guys in #debian are odd.
2008-04-25T13:15:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,thats not my problem
2008-04-25T14:33:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,apt-file ?
2008-05-01T14:10:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,it's basiclly power managment
2008-05-01T14:12:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"Well, ACPI _is_ power management. What is the missing link between ACPI and an available clocksource?"
2008-05-01T14:12:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"I'd have to read the docs on that, but I imagine it changes clock source for you to scale things down"
2008-05-01T14:12:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,you may want to look at kernel docs for that
2008-05-01T14:13:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I will consult the kernel documentation.
2008-05-02T12:29:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,according to the docs it doesn't appear to be index files
2008-05-02T12:44:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,did it use files ?
2008-05-02T12:47:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Nautilus calls the type of Tracker files 'db documents'. Don't thea include indexes?
2008-05-02T12:47:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"possibly, I was reading the docs when you asked, I don't know"
2008-05-02T12:47:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,What docs do you refer to?
2008-05-02T12:48:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,on soureforge and the ubuntu wiki
2008-05-02T12:48:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Thank you for your information.
2008-05-06T14:13:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,you may get better info from #gnome
2008-05-10T01:57:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"what do you mean classify, it uses the font server"
2008-05-10T01:59:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Hardy deals with different fonts differently. I would like to know what Hardy knows of classes of fonts which it treats differntly. One example: GNOME terminal only allows certain fonts.
2008-05-10T02:01:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,that should be controlled through xft the font server I believe
2008-05-10T02:03:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"Do you mean this: 'detlef@MD97600:~$ apropos xft; Xft (3) - X FreeType interface library; xft-config (1)       - report Xft version, compiler, linker, and/or installation directory information.'?"
2008-05-10T02:04:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,I do
2008-05-10T02:04:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Thank you.
2008-05-10T02:04:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"thats not fact, thats as I believe."
2008-05-14T17:25:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,you may want to ask in #gnome
2008-05-14T17:26:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Do you consider ubunteros do not use Tracker?
2008-05-14T17:26:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"no, ubuntu uses tracker also"
2008-05-14T17:26:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"but ubuntu didn't 'make' tracker, the guys who made it are in #gnome and you may get a better and more detailed response"

2008-05-19T20:02:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"no problem, you seem to spend a lot of time going under the hood in gnome, so that guide/doc will probably help you, it is quite big though"
2008-05-19T20:06:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Yes. I am thankful to you for your hint.
2008-05-19T20:06:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,no problem
2008-05-21T21:59:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,I gave you the system admin guide for gnome
2008-05-21T21:59:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,it should be in that guide
2008-05-21T22:31:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I have read in the document which you recommended to me last night for 4 hours. I have found a rather obvious statement: 'The Recent Documents submenu lists the documents you have recently opened. The last entry in the submenu clears the list.' I have found also several Gtk+ functions related to recently-used. But I have not found the direct answer to the question which I put here in this channel.

2008-07-02T13:24:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,What do you mean by 'regular basis'?
2008-07-02T13:25:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,to keep them on sync you'll have to export and import the files between the two machines at regular intervals
2008-07-02T13:26:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"The export and import of common files at regular intervals will I have to organize myself, or does Evolution provide assistive routines for that?"
2008-07-02T13:27:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"no you'll have to do that yourself, as global address books are normally handled by a middle ground such as ldap"

2008-07-08T12:09:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,The phrase ' end of discussion' is unfriendly. It takes the attitude of a master slave relationship and not a relationship among peers.
2008-07-08T12:09:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"no, it means there is nothing more to discuss on that, my comment was a fact"

2008-07-09T15:41:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,do you need a virtual manager ?
2008-07-09T15:42:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I do not know what do you mean by an application 'virtual manager'. So I cannot tell if I need a virtual manager.
2008-07-09T15:42:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,Virtual Manager is an interface to KVM
2008-07-09T15:45:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I do not use any kernel_based_virtual_machine.
2008-07-09T15:45:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,then you don't need that tool

2008-07-14T13:05:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,it's not - it's responding to 'link_status' from the network card
2008-07-14T13:08:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Is there a manpage describing the 'link_status' signal?

2008-08-09T13:37:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,the exclimation marks are 'normally' on ntfs partitions because gparted can't read them
2008-08-09T13:37:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,' it can't read' may mean in a ntfs partition that on this computer that the  ntfs driver is not installed?
2008-08-09T13:38:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"it probably means gparted is not setup to read the ntfs partition because it doesn't want to, eg; why does it care about the data"
2008-08-09T13:39:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I need time to think it over.  --  Thank you very much for your valuable explanations.

2008-08-09T14:48:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,On two Ubuntu 8.04 laptops the module fuse is installed. But on one Gparted shows the NTFS partitions as 'can't read the contents of this partition'. How to troubleshoot?

2008-08-17T21:44:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I believe that 'reference design' is an established term in the industry. I believe it is in large part independent of Atheros.

2008-08-17T21:45:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,#ubuntu is not for learning industry standard phrases
2008-08-17T21:45:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Quite the opposite. My Ubuntu does not work 100% and I need to learn what is wrong.
2008-08-17T21:45:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,then we can help you debug it
2008-08-17T21:45:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,whats the problem ?
2008-08-18T21:46:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,can you start it manually ?

2008-08-21T14:34:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Google does not know any 'audio sequencer for alsa'. So this practically does not exist.
2008-08-23T15:49:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,depends what you want / don't want
2008-08-23T15:49:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,if your considering replacing it you obviously know what one does against the other or you wouldn't be considering replacing it
2008-08-23T15:49:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,have you considered installing along side each other ?
2008-08-23T15:50:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I haven't yet. I do not know if there are side-effects.
2008-08-23T15:50:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,depends what uses xterm
2008-08-23T15:50:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"why not have them both on your machine, and just call which one you want"
2008-08-23T15:51:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,My main use of xterm is Irssi.
2008-08-23T15:51:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,so why do you want to change ?
2008-08-23T15:51:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,also other things may link against/be linked by xterm
2008-08-23T15:51:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,so consider that before removing it (removing it is not the same as not using it)
2008-08-23T15:52:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,xterm does not accept Unicodes as an input.
2008-08-23T15:52:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"interesting, I thought it could"
2008-08-23T15:52:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"no matter, why not install it along side xterm"
2008-08-26T11:05:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,please - thats nothing to do with ubuntu
2008-08-26T11:06:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"your persistantly asking for general help, please stop"
2008-08-26T11:08:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,stop - he was giving you advice
2008-08-26T11:08:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,you persistantly do this - so please stop now and take it to a more appropriate channel
2008-08-26T12:50:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,what is the name of the packge you want
2008-08-26T12:50:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,isn't there a compiz option for a magnifying section of the screen
2008-08-26T12:55:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,none it is then
2008-08-26T12:55:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,xzoom
2008-08-26T12:55:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,use the package manager to search for zoom / magnify
2008-08-26T12:55:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,it's a keyword search
2008-08-26T14:26:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,you've been asked multiple times to stop asking for generic help
2008-08-26T14:26:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"please please, stop"
2008-08-26T14:26:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,this is for ubuntu support questions only
2008-08-26T14:27:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Take notice that I am asking about an Ubuntu Linux article.
2008-08-26T14:27:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,no your not
2008-08-30T18:40:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,battery status interfaces as I recall
2008-08-30T18:42:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I cannot find the relation to reality. BAT0 exist. BAT1 is questionable. It is shown with a zero design capacity. As far as I can see I can see only one battery. What phantom is there listed?
2008-08-30T18:43:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,thinkpads (you use thinkpads don't you? ) have an interface for the second batter in the cdrom try
2008-08-30T18:45:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"I have got a Thinkpad T42, yes. I will consider the possibility that a battery in the CD-ROM tray is meant. --  Thank you for your suggestion."
2008-08-30T18:46:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"if you look on the thinkpad site, you'll see you can buy batteries for the ultra bay slot, so there is an interface in the kernel for a second batter on thinkpads"
2008-08-30T18:46:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"Yes, thank you. I will do a bit snooping."
2008-08-31T13:10:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,is this in relation to your thinkpad ?
2008-08-31T13:11:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,No. Not in particular. This module exists and works also in another laptop computer which is not an IBM thinkpad.
2008-08-31T13:12:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"basiclly a memory 'status' holder, eg: if your volume is set to 10, and you knock it down to 8 - the fact that it's held at 8 is stored in nvram"
2008-08-31T13:13:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"but this is nothing to do with ubuntu - as normal, so I must ask you to take it to a more appropriate channel unless you have an ubuntu specific question"
2008-08-31T13:13:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,But is this information not held in the CMOS RAM proper?
2008-08-31T13:13:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,no
2008-08-31T13:39:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,The nvram module is provided by Ubuntu; it is part of the Ubuntu distribution.
2008-08-31T13:39:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"no it's not, it's a kernel module, provided by the kernel. Nothing to do with ubuntu"
2008-08-31T13:41:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Every Ubuntu distribution is delivered with a kernel. Without a kernel a Ubuntu distribution would not function.
2008-08-31T13:42:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"no-one says it doesn't but your asking for information about a kernel module in general what it does etc, thats nothing to do with ubuntu. Ubuntu is not your personal guide to 'linux' ubuntu is for ubuntu support requests, not generic linux help/questions"
2008-09-11T21:01:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,not in #ubuntu please
2008-09-11T21:02:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Ubuntu users should not use sgrep?
2008-09-11T21:02:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,thats generic linux command help
2008-09-22T15:07:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"you don't 'need' the inetd process, thats up to you if you want to use it, some applications such as telnet/mail/swat etc etc, can be wrapped with inetd to be 'launch on demand'"
2008-09-22T15:08:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Thank you for explaining.
2008-09-22T15:12:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Does your enumeration include wall?
2008-09-22T15:12:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,wall is not a damon
2008-09-22T15:13:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Does your enumeration include rwalld?
2008-09-22T15:13:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Ok.
2008-09-22T15:13:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,that doesn't mean it's not possible
2008-09-22T17:45:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,what was that for ?
2008-09-22T17:46:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I made a mistake when I organized my bookmarks. My apologies.
2008-09-22T17:46:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"ah, no problem"
2008-09-24T16:07:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,no authentication method advailable for advertising
2008-09-24T16:08:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Why do I need advertising?
2008-09-24T16:10:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,if things want to connect to it
2008-09-27T13:59:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"badblocks, or the vendor tools"
2008-09-27T13:59:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,badblocks
2008-09-27T13:59:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,yes
2008-09-27T14:00:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,My question was: 'Why?'
2008-09-27T14:00:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,incase you damage your disk
2008-09-27T14:01:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,There is a danger to damage my hard disk if I am using badblocks? Please elaborate.
2008-09-27T14:02:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,read about what it does and how it can try to fix things
2008-09-27T14:03:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,it's not a problem
2008-09-27T14:04:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I have read man badblocks. I cannot see why an analysis tool is a dangerous thing.
2008-09-27T14:04:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,read the important note
2008-09-28T12:44:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Yes I did. --  And did you read the question which I put here in this channel?
2008-09-28T12:42:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,did you read the important notice
2008-09-28T12:43:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,which one?
2008-09-28T12:43:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"the one that says 'don't run badblocks, let fsck manage it"
2008-09-28T12:45:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"if you want to be smart about it, I suggest you take it to a more appropriate channel as this is not an ubuntu question,"
2008-09-28T12:45:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"your persistantly asking generic linux questions, and you respond with smart responses to people trying to offer you advice/help"
2008-09-28T12:46:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,badblocks is a component of every recent Ubuntu distribution.
2008-09-28T12:47:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"yes, so it's generic"
2008-09-28T12:47:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,your not asking something specific to ubuntu
2008-09-28T12:47:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,and your attitude towards people helping you is getting tiresome
2008-10-05T13:51:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,please pelase stop asking generic linux questions in this channel
2008-10-05T13:51:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,you have been asked at least 10 times before
2008-10-05T13:51:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,please please - stop
2008-10-14T18:24:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,you said
2008-10-14T18:24:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"you can't repair sounds, you'll have to re-install them, but make sure they are not working and it's not just your media player/settings"
2008-10-14T19:13:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,I've explained what to do o
2008-10-14T19:20:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"out of interest does any other sounds play, say a random wav file or mp3"
2008-10-14T19:27:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"When I click on a .mp3 filename on the desktop, Rhythmbox will be called but there is no sound to be heard."
2008-10-14T19:27:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"ahh so it's not those sound files, it's your audio in general"
2008-10-14T19:28:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,'aplay /usr/share/sounds/startup.wav' functions. It produces a sound.
2008-10-14T19:28:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"ooh, so you know the files are ok then"
2008-10-20T14:04:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,can you paste your interfaces file please
2008-10-20T14:05:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,pastebin your interfaces file please.
2008-10-20T14:06:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,pastebin your interfaces file please.
2008-10-20T14:07:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,ActionParsnip: http://paste.ubuntuusers.de/392480/
2008-10-20T14:08:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,can you now please paste ifconfig -a please.
2008-10-20T14:10:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,http://paste.ubuntuusers.de/392481/
2008-10-20T14:11:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,if you look at your ifconfig -a output you have devices missing
2008-10-20T14:11:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"thats the problem, remove them from the interfaces file unless they appear in ifocnifg -a"
2008-10-20T14:31:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,ActionParsnip: Thank you for your help.
2008-10-21T14:27:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"perhaps modules you have manually specfied that are not part of the kernel, or thignsl ike the nvidia ones (just guessing)"
2008-10-21T14:40:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Your answer triggered me to examine the /etc/init.d/module-init-tools shell script's source text. 'Manual drivers' simply are all drivers stored in /etc/modules.
2008-10-21T14:40:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"so 'manually loaded' ones, that makes sense"
2008-10-22T13:46:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,kernel is not in multiverse or universe but the core repos
2008-10-22T13:48:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,/etc/apt/sources.list does not include a 'core' string. Where can I find 'core repos'?
2008-10-22T14:57:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,updates to the hardy packages
2008-10-22T15:02:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Why is it necessary to differentiate between hardy-updates and hardy proper in packages.ubuntu.com?
2008-10-22T15:02:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,so there is a base hardy - and updates made to that base hardy I assume
2008-10-22T15:03:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Hm.
2008-10-23T17:03:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,not an ubuntu question
2008-10-23T17:04:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,ALSA is no part of Ubuntu?
2008-10-23T17:04:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"yes, but alsa documentation and alsa it's self is nothing to do with ubuntu"
2008-10-23T17:04:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,ALSA and ubuntu are very well linked.
2008-10-23T17:05:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,no they are not
2008-10-23T17:05:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,alsa is nothing to do with ubuntu
2008-10-23T17:05:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,ubuntu uses alsa - thats it
2008-11-10T16:47:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,you know this is nothing to do with ubuntu
2008-11-10T16:47:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,STOP askign offtopic help
2008-11-14T19:02:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,you know this is english only channel
2008-11-24T19:13:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,come on - you know the topic - support
2008-12-09T18:57:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,because they are archives not text
2008-12-09T18:58:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,hm. ok.
2008-12-19T15:15:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"just archives, you can delete them"
2008-12-19T15:16:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,ok.
2008-12-19T17:21:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"come on, you know it's english here"
2008-12-19T17:22:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,sri
2008-12-19T17:24:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,there is a flag for that something like date -c 7
2008-12-19T17:24:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"sorry, not you"
2008-12-22T13:10:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,check the gnome docs
2008-12-22T13:11:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"it's basiclly just the type of file it is, eg: normally based of the extension of the file"
2008-12-22T13:11:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,What do you mean by 'the' gnome docs? I do not know a collection that is comprehensive.
2008-12-22T13:11:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,docs.gnome.org
2008-12-22T13:13:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,sorry that url has changed it's http://library.gnome.org/
2008-12-22T13:13:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Thank you.
2008-12-22T16:48:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,is this really an ubuntu question ?
2008-12-22T16:48:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,It is in a file that Ubuntu provides.
2008-12-22T16:49:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,mime types are not defined by ubuntu
2008-12-29T16:09:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,is it a driver messages ?
2008-12-29T16:09:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,isn't it something to do with a wirless card kernel module
2008-12-29T16:11:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"It is a term related to networking, not necessarily to wireless."
2008-12-29T16:11:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"I thought 'rt' was a wirless kernel module,"
2008-12-29T16:12:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I do not know yet what 'rt' stands for.
2008-12-29T16:12:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,I think (reasonabley confident) it's a kernel module message for a wirless driver
2008-12-29T16:13:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"Ok, I will see if I understand the manpage better now."
2009-01-02T16:02:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,in what respect
2009-01-02T16:03:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I do not understand what that information this message conveys.
2009-01-02T16:03:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,what are doing
2009-01-02T16:04:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I am dispalying the most manpage.
2009-01-02T16:04:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I am displaying the most manpage.
2009-01-02T16:04:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,I'm not even aware of a command called most
2009-01-02T16:04:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,and that is quite generic linux - again not ubuntu
2009-01-02T16:05:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,It is package that Ubuntu provides.
2009-01-02T16:05:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,no - it is a generic command included in all linux distros
2009-01-03T16:01:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,come on !
2009-01-03T16:02:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,how many times do we go over this
2009-01-03T16:03:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"you KNOW this channel is gor ubuntu support only, not general linux support or software source development"
2009-01-03T16:03:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,please consider this a final warning
2009-01-09T13:56:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,/usr/share/men
2009-01-09T13:56:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,/usr/share/man
2009-01-09T13:58:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Thank you.
2009-01-29T20:27:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"one is the real card, the other is a bridge to it"
2009-01-29T20:27:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Which one is the bridge?
2009-01-29T20:27:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,wifi0 I believe
2009-01-29T20:28:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,ath0 is the physical card
2009-01-29T20:28:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Ah! Thank you very much.
2009-01-30T02:00:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,I can't see a flag for hostname -d
2009-01-30T02:00:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I do not understand your message. I did not speak about any flag.
2009-01-30T02:00:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,-d is a flagf
2009-01-30T02:01:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,-d is the dns domain name
2009-01-30T02:01:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"Ah, I understand now. I would call that '-d' a switch."
2009-01-30T02:02:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"switch, thats fine too"
2009-02-03T17:38:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,what version of ubuntu are you using ?
2009-02-03T17:38:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Ubuntu 8.04.2.
2009-02-03T17:39:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"ahhh, never mind, I'd read about a bug in 8.10"
2009-02-11T17:13:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"come on, how is that 'ubuntu'"
2009-02-16T21:26:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,different files deleted from different gvfsd file systems ?
2009-02-16T21:27:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"Yes, this may have been the case. But I do not remember well."
2009-02-16T21:27:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"I'm only assuming,"
2009-02-16T21:28:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,kill the processes ?
2009-02-16T21:29:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I will kill them bravely.
2009-02-16T21:29:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,I would too
2009-02-16T21:33:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,hmw I killed 3 of them using System Monitor. They did not re-appear.
2009-02-16T21:33:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,seems a good sign
2009-02-26T13:43:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,evolution site E?
2009-02-26T13:43:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,evolution site ?
2009-02-26T13:44:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I will do some more snooping using your suggestion.
2009-02-26T16:13:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,is it packaged as an ubuntu package ?
2009-02-26T16:14:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I don't know that.
2009-02-26T16:14:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,worth checking
2009-02-26T16:25:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,the repo didn't install it or did you install from a 3rd party deb  ?
2009-02-26T16:27:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I do not understand your question. A repro is a copy of a painting or document. And I cannot decipher the meaning of the message.
2009-02-28T21:16:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,that is not an ubuntu issue
2009-03-20T14:36:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,what ar eyou trying to do ?
2009-03-20T14:36:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,which command ?
2009-03-20T14:36:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,The command 'net time'.
2009-03-20T14:37:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,ok - so net time is for use in a samba DOMAIN - is your machine part of a samba domain ?
2009-03-20T14:38:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"Yes, it is. This domain may not be functional at the moment as the other computer in the LAN is switched off though.)"
2009-03-20T14:39:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,thats why then
2009-03-20T14:39:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,it is querying the domain master for the time
2009-03-20T14:41:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"if you read the error message 'can't contact server' it is explaining it can't contact the server that gets time from (for what ever reason, it's turned off maybe)"
2009-03-20T14:42:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I will get informed what a Samba domain master is.
2009-03-20T14:42:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,the domain master is the server that is the 'domain controller' for your domaain
2009-03-20T14:42:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,how did you setup a domain without knowing what the domain master is ?
2009-03-20T14:43:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,You will not believe it: I managed to set up a functioning Samba domain. All myself.
2009-03-20T14:43:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,I do believe it - but I don't know how you can do that if you don't know what the domain master is  ?
2009-03-24T13:04:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,pastebin your lspci output
2009-03-24T13:06:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,http://paste.ubuntuusers.de/394574/
2009-03-24T13:08:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,very interesting
2009-03-24T13:08:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,the only thing I can think of is that either a.) the wrong audio module is being detected/loaded b.) the module descritption is wrong c.) bug in the gui
2009-03-24T13:10:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"Ok, I will enquire somewhat more."
2009-03-26T16:26:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"/etc/init.d/udev is a file, not a dir"
2009-03-26T16:26:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Yes. I made a mistake. A typo. I will re-word and re-transmit.
2009-03-26T16:27:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,thanks
2009-03-26T16:27:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,check the permissions on it ?
2009-03-26T16:28:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,on /etc/init.d/udev I mean to be clear
2009-03-26T16:28:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I used Nautilus and 'Search for files' as an ordinary user. Not as root.
2009-03-26T16:29:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,just curious to the permissions on it
2009-03-26T16:30:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,The permissions are root/root
2009-03-26T16:30:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"thats the owner, what's the permissions"
2009-03-26T16:32:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,':~$  ls -l /etc/init.d/udev; -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 2488 2008-04-11 14:21 /etc/init.d/udev'
2009-03-26T16:32:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,all looks pretty fine
2009-03-26T16:32:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,ahhh what about the permissions on /etc/init.d
2009-03-26T16:34:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,':~$ ls -l /etc/; drwxr-xr-x  2 root root     12288 2009-03-24 07:28 init.d'
2009-04-01T17:09:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,System > Administration does not show an 'Device Manager' entry in Ubuntu 8.04.

2009-04-01T17:11:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,system -> hardware something like that
2009-04-01T17:25:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"System > Control Center > Hardware > Sound opens the dialog 'Sound Preferences'. There exists a tab 'Devices' which allows me to select 'Devicess', among other things. In a way, one could call that a 'sound device manager' but I consider this rather remote. Can you comment."
2009-04-01T17:25:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,seems like the right application
2009-04-01T17:25:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"Ok, thank you."
2009-05-01T16:05:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"the fstab entry will tell your OS where to mount the file systems - nothing more, there is no intellegence behind it"
2009-05-01T16:10:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,The intelligence could be in the filesystem.
2009-05-01T16:10:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,there isn't any
2009-05-01T16:11:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,it's dumb - it does what you tell it
2009-05-01T16:11:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,hm
2009-05-20T17:59:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,you know the topic of this channel is ubuntu support - not channel finding help
2009-05-20T17:59:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,:-)
2009-07-02T12:11:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,enable your wirless card
2009-07-02T12:11:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,hehe. I just asked how to enable it.
2009-07-02T12:11:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,normally with a kill switch on the machine
2009-07-02T12:12:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,My computer does not have a hardware kill switch.
2009-07-02T12:12:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,is it a PC or a laptop
2009-07-02T12:12:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,It is a laptop computer.
2009-07-02T12:13:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,then it will either have a kill switch or a kill key sequence
2009-07-02T20:14:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,device up
2009-07-02T20:15:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Thank you.
2009-07-30T13:41:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,gdm settings maybe ?
2010-06-13T14:31:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,one is a script that calls the binary
2010-06-13T14:33:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,The process seamonkey-2.0 still exists. I cannot think of any reasonable reason to call a binary using a skript process that does not end immediately. Why did the process seamonkey-2.0 not terminate?
2010-06-13T14:34:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"it works the same in firefox, a script calls the binary"
2010-06-13T14:34:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Right.
2010-06-13T14:34:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,if you look you'll find the run-mozilla.sh still runs after firefox has started
2010-06-13T14:36:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I have no doubt that your statement is true.
2010-07-31T22:55:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,setuid
2010-07-31T22:57:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Thank you for your help.
2010-08-05T13:39:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,that's nothing to do with ubuntu
2010-08-05T13:39:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,extensions cacn mean anything you want
2010-08-05T13:41:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,hm
2010-08-28T13:21:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"you can tell any application to use it, it's just a mount point"
2010-08-28T13:21:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,nogo Thank you very much for your help.
2010-09-22T19:53:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,is that an ubuntu or a gnome question ?
2010-09-22T19:53:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,This is a Ubuntu question.
2010-09-22T19:53:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,whey did you prefix it with {GNOME}
2010-09-22T19:54:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,To narrow down the scope.
2010-10-12T00:46:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,that is in the dpkg and apt documentation
2010-10-12T00:47:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I will have a look into these 2 manual pages.
2010-10-12T00:54:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,it's in the documentation
2010-10-31T17:35:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,ask the guys in #openoffice.org
2010-10-31T17:36:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I beg your pardon?
2010-10-31T17:36:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,ask the guys in #openoffice.org channel
2010-11-16T15:22:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,chu_ is on in the channel
2011-01-30T01:44:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"is partition 5 a logical container for logical partitions, or a logical partition"
2011-01-30T01:45:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,/dev/sda5 is a logical partition.
2011-01-30T01:45:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"are there any other logical partitions in it, or does it have a partent logical partition"
2011-01-30T01:47:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I do not know what a 'partent ligical partition' is. There are other logical partions on this computer: sda6 though 10.
2011-01-30T01:47:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,what is /dev/sda4 ?
2011-01-30T01:48:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,/dev/sda does not exist.
2011-01-30T01:48:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"I said /dev/sda4 !, not /dev/sda"
2011-01-30T01:48:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,/dev/sda4 does not exist.
2011-01-30T01:48:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,/dev/sda MUST exist for you to have /dev/sda5
2011-01-30T01:48:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,pastebin me the output of sudo fdisk -l please
2011-01-30T01:53:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,http://paste.ubuntu.com/560029/
2011-01-30T01:54:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"ok the reason you can't delete sda5 is because sda5 is a container for sda6,7,8,9,10, none of those must be mounted or in use in any way if you wish to delete /dev/sda5"
2011-01-30T01:55:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"be aware if you delete /dev/sda5 6,7,8,9,10 will also go"
2011-01-30T02:00:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,How have you seen that sda5 is a container for sda6 though 10?
2011-01-30T02:00:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"I'm wrong, 2 is the container"
2011-01-30T02:00:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,I read it wrong
2011-01-30T02:00:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,ok
2011-01-30T14:10:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,because it's running from a livecd
2011-01-30T14:10:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"or someones set the PS1 prompt,"
2011-01-30T14:10:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Both men are running from a Live CD.
2011-01-30T14:11:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"yes, but the gparted project on sourceforge is not run from the ubuntu livecd"
2011-01-30T14:15:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"Yes, apparently someone set the PS1 prompt differently. --  Thank you."
2011-01-30T14:34:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,are you running from a livecd ?
2011-01-30T14:34:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Yes.
2011-01-30T14:58:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"that paste is useless, it's just html"
2011-01-30T14:59:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I do not understand why the paste is useless. Please elaborate.
2011-01-30T15:00:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"because the paste shows a lot of html code,"
2011-01-30T15:01:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,The GParted program offers this file output format.
2011-01-30T15:01:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,that doesn't make it good - it's usless
2011-01-30T15:01:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Ah! Understood.
2011-01-30T15:08:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"I copied the GParted error output file to a USB stick, plugged the USB stick into another Ubuntu computer and Firefox could perfectly read the file in a well-formatted manner."
2011-01-30T16:11:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,please pastebin the output of 'sudo fdisk -l'
2011-01-30T16:15:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,http://paste.ubuntu.com/560172
2011-01-30T17:11:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,the reason you are having problems resizing is due to a lack of available space (unallocated) space on your disk
2011-01-30T17:30:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,How did you calculate that? 20.20 GiB are not allocated. I'd like to use them.
2011-01-30T17:30:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"look at the start/end cylinders, they are all allocated"
2011-01-30T17:32:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Between sda6 and sda7 3631 through 6267 are not allocated.
2011-01-30T17:33:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,but they are logical so they are contained in /dev/sda2 so 'allocated'
2011-01-30T17:36:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"I admit that thery are within /dev/sda2. But: This is not important. /dev/sda6 is also there. Still, I manged to move it."
2011-01-30T17:36:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"it is important, if you look at how the free space is laid out"
2011-01-30T17:38:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,/dev/sda2 allwed me to move partition sda6. So it should allow me to move the partition sda7 likewise.
2011-01-30T17:39:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,I disagree due to how the space is laid out. It may not hurt to re-read the partition table if you have done resizing so gparted knows it's current status
2011-01-30T17:40:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,The output of '~$ sudo fdisk -l' which I pasted is the current state. No upgrading needed.
2011-01-30T17:41:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"again, I disagree as gparted things there is no space free or none-readable. If you want advice, follow it, if you want to ignore it and argue it, good luck"
2011-01-30T17:42:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Thank you for advising.
2011-02-05T19:56:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,you'll need to follow the include's up the scripts
2011-02-05T19:58:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,This task is difficult to accomplish here as I cannot recognize a file (or script) hierarchy.
2011-02-05T19:59:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,why do you want to know then ?
2011-02-05T20:01:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Someone asked how he could determine how his Ubuntu computer was put back to work after sleeping.
2011-02-05T20:01:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"ok, so if you are unable to follow the script tree backwards as it is too hard, you won't be able to do this task"
2011-02-05T20:02:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,ok.
2011-03-17T16:40:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"it's the disk ID and partitoin for your system, X and Y are place holders that you swap out relevant to your system"
2011-03-17T16:57:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,why di dyou use update-manager -d ?
2011-03-17T16:57:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,did you intend to go to the development release?
2011-03-17T16:58:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Yes I did.
2011-03-17T16:58:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,then it's not supported and disscussion is in #ubuntu+1
2011-03-17T16:59:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,No. There is no diskcussion in #ubuntu+1.
2011-03-17T17:00:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"thats sad, but it's where the discussion for ubuntu 111.04 is, please join"
2011-03-17T17:00:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,11.04-pre-release is not a supported distro
2011-03-17T17:00:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,at their systems that they use to type messaages
2011-03-17T17:02:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,it's been explained to you please join #ubuntu+1
2011-04-12T16:54:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,the output of ps -ef shows the parent id for each process
2011-04-12T16:56:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Thank you very much for your help.
2011-05-16T17:43:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,because it's not in your locate cache path
2011-05-16T17:44:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,also there is no extension on that file
2011-05-16T17:44:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,'in addition'
2011-05-16T17:46:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"database is not a file name for mysql, database.blah is"
2011-05-16T17:46:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"so a.) the path of the file would need to be in your locate cache path b.) you need to specify the full file name, eg: mydatabase.mdf"
2011-05-16T17:48:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"they are files, but you need to specify the extension"
2011-05-29T19:34:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,#openoffice.org
2011-05-29T19:40:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I know #ubuntuoffice.org. Do you?
2011-05-29T19:40:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"I don't know that channel, only #openoffice.org"
2011-05-29T19:40:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I know #openoffice.org. Do you?
2011-05-29T19:40:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"yes, that's why I asked you to take you're question to the channel"
2011-05-29T19:47:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,The DEB program package openoffice.org-base has even the word 'ubuntu' in its installed version number: 1.3.3.0-7ubuntu4.2. And you are telling me that this does not belong to Ubuntu.
2011-05-29T19:47:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,I'm telling you learning how to use openoffice would be better served in #openoffice.org
2011-05-29T19:52:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"no, it's not"
2011-05-29T19:52:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"sorry, not you"

2011-06-13T01:34:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,pardon ?
2011-06-13T01:35:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,How should I interpret this Ubuntu installer message?
2011-06-13T01:39:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,it's pretty much saying 'ready when you are'
2011-06-13T01:45:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Thank you for your help.
2011-06-16T13:24:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,it's a system binding
2011-06-16T13:24:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Can you elaborate.
2011-06-16T13:25:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,no
2011-06-16T21:13:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,press F12 and find out
2011-06-16T21:14:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Your message is not helpful.
2011-06-16T21:14:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"it is, press F12 and find out what it does, it won't be anything dangerous"
2011-06-17T14:11:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"later version, enchancments ?"
2011-06-23T16:03:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"I believe the kernel source package contains the documentation, if by documentation you mean the README for that kernel"
2011-06-23T16:05:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Thank you.
2011-07-01T12:50:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,Xorg
2011-07-01T13:07:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Your answer is wrong. On my Ubuntu 11.04 is no Xorg running but .xsession-errors is not empty.
2011-07-01T13:08:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,my answer is not wrong
2011-07-01T13:09:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Reiterating is no help. You need to prove your statement.
2011-07-01T13:09:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"no, I don't you need to read the documentation on it"
2011-07-01T13:09:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,:-)
2011-07-01T17:00:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,ask the guys in gnome -
2011-07-01T17:00:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I did.
2011-07-01T17:01:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"ok - so it's not an ubuntu question, as you know"
2011-07-09T14:36:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,that's the default file to use
2011-07-09T14:37:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"well, it does, as unless you have changed it to not use the default file - it will use the default file"
2011-07-09T14:37:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,That is correct.
2011-07-09T14:38:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,so there is your answer
2011-07-09T14:38:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Thank you.
2011-07-10T15:00:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,do a search for redirect.log

2011-07-10T15:01:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,'~$ locate redirect.log' does not produce any output.
2011-07-10T15:02:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,looking at the man page --redirect.log is not a valid option

2011-07-10T15:04:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"I consulted the manpage before I posted here. --redirect log is not listed there as an option. Still, the GNOME menu uses this option. I believe that the manpage is outdated. It is dated 2009."
2011-07-10T15:05:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"well, I don't believe it is,"

2011-07-10T15:05:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,do you see the option?
2011-07-10T15:06:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I do not see the option. But --help does not list all options.
2011-07-10T15:07:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"so the man page doesn't list it, --help doesn't list it, and the command doesn't appear to work, so that to me suggests it's not a valid option"
2011-07-10T15:07:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"or the option isn't doing what you expect it to do, eg: it's actually not a log file redirector"
2011-07-10T15:07:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"Yes, this may be an explanation. --  Thank you."
2011-07-16T19:32:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"if you look in the gnome docs, it will be the default location"
2011-09-09T22:16:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,have you installed it ?
2011-09-09T22:17:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,have you looked in the repos ?
2011-09-15T19:22:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,should be
2011-09-15T19:23:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Thank you.
2011-09-15T19:24:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,that doesn't not contain the 'mail' command
2011-09-17T11:58:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,what daily build number ?
2011-09-17T12:01:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,The one that is referred to here: http://www.mail-archive.com/kvm@vger.kernel.org/msg22945.html
2011-09-17T12:01:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,what version of ubuntu are you running ?
2011-09-19T13:29:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,as always a quick google is your friend http://code.google.com/p/eiskaltdc/
2011-09-19T13:30:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Thank you for your help.
2011-12-20T02:38:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,why does it matter ?
2011-12-20T02:38:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,it's a file name
2011-12-20T17:06:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,could you rephrase the question as it doesn't make sense
2011-12-20T17:07:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,maybe give a real world example in a pastebin if it helps
2011-12-20T18:38:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,it filters results normally
2011-12-20T18:39:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,'normally' is no useful description for an instruction for use.
2011-12-20T18:39:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,ok then 'read the documentation' that should give you a useful description
2012-01-25T14:18:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,not an ubuntu issue
2012-01-25T15:59:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,ok ?
2012-01-25T16:00:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Your message is too short to be comprehensible.
2012-01-25T16:00:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,your message had no question to it
2012-01-25T16:01:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,My message has a question mark at its end. Therefore it is a question.
2012-01-25T16:02:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,are you actually asking why the wording / description has changed ?
2012-01-25T16:03:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I am asking why Ubuntu 11.10 Synaptic does not attach the same notice to that package as Ubuntu Synaptic did before.
2012-01-25T16:03:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,because it's a different version of the package ?
2012-01-25T16:04:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,No. It is the same version.
2012-01-25T16:04:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"you'll have to contact the package maintainer to find out why he has changed the text in the description field, only he can tell you that"
2012-01-25T16:04:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"it doesn't really matter, it's an ubuntu package, coming from the ubuntu repos, so the validity of the package is still the same"
2012-01-25T16:05:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,'I see your point. --  Thank you.
2012-01-25T21:34:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,you can also look in the password file
2012-01-30T16:06:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,sounds like a bug
2012-01-30T16:09:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I suspected that too.
2012-02-04T19:59:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"look at what that shortkey key does, see if the file it's calling is there"
2012-02-04T20:00:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,What 'shortkey' do you mean?
2012-02-04T20:00:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,'super-key -> epihany'
2012-02-04T20:02:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"This is no shortkey. Tthis is the normal GNOME Shell way to call an application program, in my case the application 'Epiphany'. And indeed, the Epiphany symbol appears."
2012-02-04T20:02:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,ok - so look at what that icon links to
2012-02-04T20:03:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,or launch it manually and work it through
2012-02-10T15:29:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,where are you getting that message ?
2012-02-10T15:30:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,where are you getting that message ?
2012-02-10T15:30:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"is this question an ubuntu support issue, or a generic kernel question ?"
2012-02-10T15:30:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I am referring to an actual Ubuntu program-
2012-02-10T15:31:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,which ubuntu program ?
2012-02-10T15:32:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,The name of the Ubuntu program is 'poweroff'.
2012-02-10T15:32:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,how do you launch it
2012-02-10T15:32:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,as from what you are saying you are reading the power off function in the kernel
2012-02-10T15:33:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,could you please clarify
2012-02-10T15:33:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,'[11:32] <ikonia> bullgard4: how do you launch it' <- Please read 'man poweroff' for an answer.
2012-02-10T15:33:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"no, I'm asking you"
2012-02-10T15:34:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"if you want help - respond to questions, don't tell me to read the man pages"
2012-02-10T15:35:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I have used the program 'poweroff' in the command '~$ sudo poweroff'.
2012-02-10T15:35:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,ok - if you look that's actually a symlink
2012-02-10T15:36:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,what is your actual questions
2012-02-10T15:36:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Your message does not answer my question at the outset.
2012-02-10T15:36:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,because you have not asked a question
2012-02-10T15:36:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,or at least one that is clear
2012-02-10T15:36:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I know that well. And It does not answer the question which I put at the outset.
2012-02-10T15:36:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,so if you have an ubuntu specific support question please ask
2012-02-10T15:37:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Please read what I wrote bewfore and take notice and try to understand the meaning in it.
2012-02-10T15:37:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"it doesn't make sense, which is why I'm asking you to clarify your question"
2012-02-10T15:42:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,It does not make sense asking for the meaning of a term that is used in a Ubuntu-made source ccode? Oh dear.
2012-02-10T15:42:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,it is NOT ubuntu made source code
2012-02-10T15:48:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,please check your private messages
2007-07-13T08:20:00.000Z,bullgard4,,My computer stores about 40 files containing 'hwmon' in their names. What is the meaning of 'hwmon'?
2007-07-13T08:20:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,at a guess 'hardware monitor' logs
2007-07-13T08:20:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,What do you mean with 'hardware monitor logs'?
2007-07-30T13:38:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,you can upload it to launchpad with the repot a bug option
2007-07-30T13:39:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"I do not understand your phrase 'with the repot a bug option'. Say it in other words, please."
2007-07-30T13:39:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,launchpad allows you to upload docs when you report a bug
2007-07-30T13:40:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,And where will the docs be stored? How can I store those documents?
2007-07-30T13:41:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I will try it again.
2007-09-12T06:50:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,just name
2007-09-12T06:50:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,hm
2007-11-22T21:39:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,what probem
2007-11-28T01:33:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,can you tell me your question please as I missed it
2007-11-28T01:35:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia, Why does getty start so late? (In  http://www.bootchart.org/images/bootchart.debian.mcrae.0.png 38 seconds after INIT) I thought it only depends on INIT.
2007-11-28T01:37:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"getty should only need the network stack up, nothing else, I think its started last as its an ancillery application rather than a core service"
2007-11-28T01:38:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,if you look at that chart you'll see core services are started first so that looks like a selection choice rather than technical dependency as that is only the tcp stack
2007-11-28T01:38:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,ompaul does that make sense to you ?
2007-11-28T01:39:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I need longer time to think about your statement. Thank you very much for commenting.
2007-11-28T01:40:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"here is other food for thought. getty is launched off init, init is the first thing thats launched so what you 'may' be seeing in your image is getty is spawned by init but not actually 'started' until you login which is why your chart is showing it last"
2007-11-28T01:40:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,it depends how that chart is made I guess
2007-11-28T01:40:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,just more food for thought
2007-11-28T01:48:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I disagree with that 'it depends how that chart is made'. My laptop computer shows a similar behaviour. I would like to find out why. This situation is independent of the way a start diagram is drawn. --  I do not think that getty is starting only after my login.
2007-11-29T22:33:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"why argue,"
2007-11-30T15:27:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,differentiate between kernel and xorg modules ?
2007-11-30T15:28:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I do not understand your question. There is a subject missing in it.
2007-11-30T15:29:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"you asked why differentiate between xorg and kernel modules, I'm asking you what you mean"
2007-11-30T15:29:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I was referring to jrib's message.
2007-11-30T16:53:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,this is ubuntu support only. Please ask only ubuntu support related questions
2007-11-30T16:53:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,This is Ubuntu related.
2007-11-30T16:53:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"no its not, this is ubuntu operating system support"
2007-11-30T16:56:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,different hardware
2007-11-30T16:56:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Your message is not helpful.
2007-11-30T16:56:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,it's the answer
2007-11-30T16:57:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,they are different hardware so will require different dection and boot options
2007-12-03T16:34:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,it means that process is in a stopped state
2007-12-03T16:35:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Why is this fact not expressed much simpler with '<process name> stopped'?
2007-12-03T16:36:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"its just 3 letters on the end, its expressed clearly enough"
2007-12-03T16:36:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Thank you for commenting.
2007-12-04T21:54:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,did you tell it to ?
2007-12-04T21:54:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"Yes, I think so."
2008-01-04T03:04:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,the last number is just the ubuntu build number
2008-01-04T03:05:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Thank you for explaining.
2008-01-15T20:33:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Your remark is not helpful.
2008-01-15T20:32:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"if you have to ask, yo ushould NOT be building a kernel"
2008-01-15T20:33:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,it's advice
2008-01-15T20:33:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,I stronglly suggest you consider it
2008-01-15T20:33:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Your remark is not helpful.
2008-01-15T20:33:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"it  is advice for you ro listen to, or ignore"
2008-01-16T17:17:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,X and framebuffer are two different technologies
2008-01-16T17:19:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Yes. But this does not explain that the consoles use only a part of my screen area.
2008-01-16T17:19:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,I do'nt understand your question
2008-01-16T17:20:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Please tell me what part of my question you do not understand. Or do you want me to repeat the whole message?
2008-01-16T17:21:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,your terminals and framebuffer ?
2008-01-16T17:23:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Your question is too short to be understandable for me. Please put your question in a whole sentence.
2008-01-16T17:23:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,I don't understand how your asking about framebuffers and terminals - they are totally differnt things
2008-01-16T17:24:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I am asking why my consoles do not fill the whole screen area and do not display 80 lines as directed.
2008-01-18T18:09:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,there isn't one
2008-01-18T18:10:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,What is the reason for such a situation?
2008-01-18T18:10:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,there is no such thing as a kernel command line
2008-01-18T18:10:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"you can pass kernel boot options/arugments if you want, is that what you mean"
2008-01-18T18:11:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"You are wrong. You can google for 'kernel command line', and you will find very many hits."
2008-01-18T18:11:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,no I'm not
2008-01-18T18:11:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,READ the hits that say 'kernel command line'
2008-01-18T18:12:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I am not sure that a kernel command line is defined as a variable that accespts kernel boot options.
2008-01-18T18:13:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,it is
2008-01-18T18:13:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,the kernel command line is what people are calling the boot options you can pass to the kernel
2008-01-18T18:14:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"I hear your statement. I am going to prove it. --  Thank you for your comments, anyway."
2008-01-18T18:14:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,there is nothing to prove
2008-01-18T18:15:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Why is there nothing to prove? In what respect?
2008-01-18T18:16:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"1.) there is no kernel 'command line' the options people are refering to in the links you say in google are the boot parameters passed through grub that people are calling a command line. That is not the correct name, but that is what they are calling it in the links you reference"
2008-01-18T18:18:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"I have got the feeling that you are right with your last statement, and I will make this to my base assumption. If I will encounter contradictions to that, I will do further resarch. --  Thank you very much."
2008-01-21T18:36:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,it's a sound card 'high def audio'
2008-01-21T18:37:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Thank you.
2008-01-28T19:00:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,no
2008-01-31T15:31:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,no-one has packaged it
2008-01-31T15:31:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,it's that simple
2008-02-13T21:32:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,there is no manual
2008-02-13T21:33:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,why are you trying to build a kernel
2008-02-13T21:34:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I am not going to build a kernel now. I am going to learn and understand before I go to compile my own kernel.
2008-02-13T21:34:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"why do you want to build a kernel, it will break your ubuntu package manager and dependant packages"
2008-02-13T21:36:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Let me repeat: ' ikonia: I am not going to build a kernel now. '
2008-02-13T21:36:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,let me repeat 'why do you want to build a kernel'
2008-02-13T21:37:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"No, I do not want to build a kernel. I would like to know how 'make menuconfig' functions or operates."
2008-02-13T21:38:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,it builds an ncruses interface to write a .config file.
2008-02-13T21:38:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Thank you for your information.
2008-02-13T22:57:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,doesn't matter what directory it's in
2008-02-13T23:00:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,May I object. It matters. I'd like to retrieve it even at a later date when I already forgot all details of my download. I'd like to do it as the more experienced users do in order to keep my Ubuntu lucid.
2008-02-13T23:00:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,where you place the source package or untar it - doesn't matter
2008-02-13T23:00:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,fact
2008-02-13T23:01:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Right. Then I will place it in  /usr/src/linux/debian/ .

2008-02-13T23:02:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Thank you for commenting.
2008-03-20T15:32:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,they are different files
2008-03-20T15:32:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,package file cache and source package fil ecache
2008-03-20T15:32:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,What is their difference?
2008-03-20T15:33:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,one is for packages one os fir source packages
2008-03-20T15:33:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,What is the difference between 'packages' and 'source packages'?
2008-03-20T15:34:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,packages and compiles source packages are the source packages used to be packages
2008-03-28T12:35:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,what are you talking about
2008-03-28T12:36:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I am talking about what I wrote.
2008-03-28T12:36:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"yes, but it doesnt make sense"
2008-03-28T12:37:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Please elaborate.
2008-03-28T12:37:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,the problem your describing doesn't make sense
2008-03-28T12:38:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,It must be your sense which cannot make it out. I have already got a response that found my question intelligible.
2008-03-28T12:39:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,your asking may you shut down a database service ?
2008-03-28T12:40:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,yes.
2008-03-28T12:44:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Please read more carefully. I mentioned the database: It is mysql.
2008-03-28T12:46:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,thats not a database
2008-03-28T12:46:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,the databases are that mysql is hosting
2008-03-28T12:47:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,so don't tell me to 'read more carefully'
2008-03-28T12:49:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"Wikipedia: 'MySQL (pronounced /maɪˌɛskjuːˈɛl/) is a multithreaded, multi-user SQL database management system.'"
2008-03-28T12:50:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,correct - so it's not a database
2008-03-28T12:50:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,hence why I'm telling you that shutting down the mysql service may cause you issues if it's hosting a database that something wants
2008-03-28T12:51:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Tautology.
2008-03-28T12:51:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,pardon ?
2008-03-28T12:52:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,why are you arguing this with me ???? I'm trying to offer you advise that will stop you having problems ???? you've had a history of not asking questions clearly I was just asking you to clarify what your asking
2008-03-30T01:14:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,why - he's running 7.10 - not 8.04
2008-03-31T12:12:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,can you do a dpkg -c on the package ?

2008-04-24T19:44:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Unification is a valuable asset in software production and usage. It is a waste to not unify a location for source code files in Linux and Ubuntu.
2008-04-24T19:44:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"ok, 'there isn't an official location'"
2008-04-24T19:45:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Ok. I notice. -- Thank you.

2008-05-01T14:12:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"Well, ACPI _is_ power management. What is the missing link between ACPI and an available clocksource?"
2008-05-01T14:12:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"I'd have to read the docs on that, but I imagine it changes clock source for you to scale things down"
2008-05-01T14:12:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,you may want to look at kernel docs for that
2008-05-01T14:13:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I will consult the kernel documentation.
2008-05-02T12:29:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,according to the docs it doesn't appear to be index files
2008-05-02T12:44:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,did it use files ?
2008-05-02T12:47:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Nautilus calls the type of Tracker files 'db documents'. Don't thea include indexes?
2008-05-02T12:47:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"possibly, I was reading the docs when you asked, I don't know"
2008-05-02T12:47:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,What docs do you refer to?
2008-05-02T12:48:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,on soureforge and the ubuntu wiki

2008-05-10T01:57:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"what do you mean classify, it uses the font server"
2008-05-10T01:59:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Hardy deals with different fonts differently. I would like to know what Hardy knows of classes of fonts which it treats differntly. One example: GNOME terminal only allows certain fonts.
2008-05-10T02:01:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,that should be controlled through xft the font server I believe
2008-05-10T02:03:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"Do you mean this: 'detlef@MD97600:~$ apropos xft; Xft (3) - X FreeType interface library; xft-config (1)       - report Xft version, compiler, linker, and/or installation directory information.'?"

2008-05-14T17:26:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Do you consider ubunteros do not use Tracker?
2008-05-14T17:26:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"no, ubuntu uses tracker also"
2008-05-14T17:26:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"but ubuntu didn't 'make' tracker, the guys who made it are in #gnome and you may get a better and more detailed response"

2008-05-21T22:31:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I have read in the document which you recommended to me last night for 4 hours. I have found a rather obvious statement: 'The Recent Documents submenu lists the documents you have recently opened. The last entry in the submenu clears the list.' I have found also several Gtk+ functions related to recently-used. But I have not found the direct answer to the question which I put here in this channel.

2008-08-09T13:35:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,the keyring means 'partition locked/in use'
2008-08-09T13:37:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,the exclimation marks are 'normally' on ntfs partitions because gparted can't read them
2008-08-09T13:37:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,' it can't read' may mean in a ntfs partition that on this computer that the  ntfs driver is not installed?
2008-08-09T13:38:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"it probably means gparted is not setup to read the ntfs partition because it doesn't want to, eg; why does it care about the data"
2008-08-09T13:39:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I need time to think it over.  --  Thank you very much for your valuable explanations.
2008-08-09T14:07:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,ntfs or ntfs-3g
2008-08-09T14:08:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"Ah, thank you."
2008-08-09T14:29:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Is the filename of the NTFS driver in Ubuntu 8.04 /bin/ntfs-3g?
2008-08-09T14:29:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"no, thats an application"
2008-08-09T14:48:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,On two Ubuntu 8.04 laptops the module fuse is installed. But on one Gparted shows the NTFS partitions as 'can't read the contents of this partition'. How to troubleshoot?
2008-08-11T14:11:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,kernel build files
2008-08-11T14:15:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Please tell me what a 'kernel build file' is.
2008-08-11T14:15:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,read the docs in the kernel source or on http://www.kernel.org
2008-08-13T18:55:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,is that really an ubuntu issue ?
2008-08-13T18:57:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"I am surprised that you are not answering but putting this question. The answer to your question is: Yes, it is. If I would use this computer in Windows, I would not be in need of this table."
2008-08-13T18:58:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"maybe I have missunderstood your question, could you please rephrease it"
2008-08-13T18:59:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I am in a hurry to answer to MikeSeth.
2008-08-13T18:59:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"ok, please re-post your question when you have chance, I'm not sure I clearly understood it"
2008-08-14T17:39:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,please don't use caps
2008-08-14T17:39:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,lsmod will show you what modules are loaded
2008-08-14T17:39:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,map them through to your sound card
2008-08-14T17:44:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,can you please stop using caps
2008-08-17T21:34:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,mail atheros and ask
2008-08-17T21:44:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I believe that 'reference design' is an established term in the industry. I believe it is in large part independent of Atheros.
2008-08-17T21:44:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"yes, therefore nothing to do with ubuntu"
2008-08-17T21:45:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,#ubuntu is not for learning industry standard phrases
2008-08-17T21:45:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Quite the opposite. My Ubuntu does not work 100% and I need to learn what is wrong.
2008-08-17T21:45:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,then we can help you debug it
2008-08-17T21:45:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,whats the problem ?
2008-08-18T21:46:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,can you start it manually ?
2008-08-21T13:59:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,audio sequencer for alsa
2008-08-21T13:59:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,hm
2008-08-21T14:34:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Google does not know any 'audio sequencer for alsa'. So this practically does not exist.
2008-08-23T15:49:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,depends what you want / don't want
2008-08-23T15:49:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,if your considering replacing it you obviously know what one does against the other or you wouldn't be considering replacing it
2008-08-23T15:49:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,have you considered installing along side each other ?
2008-08-23T15:50:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I haven't yet. I do not know if there are side-effects.
2008-08-23T15:50:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,depends what uses xterm
2008-08-23T15:50:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"why not have them both on your machine, and just call which one you want"
2008-08-23T15:51:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,My main use of xterm is Irssi.
2008-08-23T15:51:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,so why do you want to change ?
2008-08-23T15:51:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,also other things may link against/be linked by xterm
2008-08-23T15:51:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,so consider that before removing it (removing it is not the same as not using it)
2008-08-23T15:52:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,xterm does not accept Unicodes as an input.
2008-08-23T15:52:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"interesting, I thought it could"
2008-08-23T15:52:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"no matter, why not install it along side xterm"
2008-08-26T11:05:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,please - thats nothing to do with ubuntu
2008-08-26T11:06:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"your persistantly asking for general help, please stop"
2008-08-26T11:08:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,stop - he was giving you advice
2008-08-26T11:08:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,you persistantly do this - so please stop now and take it to a more appropriate channel
2008-08-26T12:50:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,what is the name of the packge you want
2008-08-26T12:50:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,isn't there a compiz option for a magnifying section of the screen
2008-08-26T12:55:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,none it is then
2008-08-26T12:55:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,xzoom
2008-08-26T12:55:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,use the package manager to search for zoom / magnify
2008-08-26T12:55:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,it's a keyword search
2008-08-26T14:26:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,you've been asked multiple times to stop asking for generic help
2008-08-26T14:26:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"please please, stop"
2008-08-26T14:26:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,this is for ubuntu support questions only
2008-08-26T14:27:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Take notice that I am asking about an Ubuntu Linux article.
2008-08-26T14:27:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,no your not
2008-08-30T18:40:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,battery status interfaces as I recall
2008-08-30T18:42:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I cannot find the relation to reality. BAT0 exist. BAT1 is questionable. It is shown with a zero design capacity. As far as I can see I can see only one battery. What phantom is there listed?
2008-08-30T18:43:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,thinkpads (you use thinkpads don't you? ) have an interface for the second batter in the cdrom try
2008-08-30T18:45:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"I have got a Thinkpad T42, yes. I will consider the possibility that a battery in the CD-ROM tray is meant. --  Thank you for your suggestion."
2008-08-30T18:46:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"if you look on the thinkpad site, you'll see you can buy batteries for the ultra bay slot, so there is an interface in the kernel for a second batter on thinkpads"
2008-08-30T18:46:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"Yes, thank you. I will do a bit snooping."
2008-08-31T13:10:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,is this in relation to your thinkpad ?
2008-08-31T13:11:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,No. Not in particular. This module exists and works also in another laptop computer which is not an IBM thinkpad.
2008-08-31T13:12:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"basiclly a memory 'status' holder, eg: if your volume is set to 10, and you knock it down to 8 - the fact that it's held at 8 is stored in nvram"
2008-08-31T13:13:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"but this is nothing to do with ubuntu - as normal, so I must ask you to take it to a more appropriate channel unless you have an ubuntu specific question"
2008-08-31T13:13:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,But is this information not held in the CMOS RAM proper?
2008-08-31T13:13:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,no
2008-08-31T13:39:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,The nvram module is provided by Ubuntu; it is part of the Ubuntu distribution.
2008-08-31T13:39:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"no it's not, it's a kernel module, provided by the kernel. Nothing to do with ubuntu"
2008-08-31T13:41:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Every Ubuntu distribution is delivered with a kernel. Without a kernel a Ubuntu distribution would not function.
2008-08-31T13:42:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"no-one says it doesn't but your asking for information about a kernel module in general what it does etc, thats nothing to do with ubuntu. Ubuntu is not your personal guide to 'linux' ubuntu is for ubuntu support requests, not generic linux help/questions"
2008-09-11T21:01:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,not in #ubuntu please
2008-09-11T21:02:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Ubuntu users should not use sgrep?
2008-09-11T21:02:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,thats generic linux command help
2008-09-22T15:07:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"you don't 'need' the inetd process, thats up to you if you want to use it, some applications such as telnet/mail/swat etc etc, can be wrapped with inetd to be 'launch on demand'"
2008-09-22T15:08:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Thank you for explaining.
2008-09-22T15:12:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Does your enumeration include wall?
2008-09-22T15:12:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,wall is not a damon
2008-09-22T15:13:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Does your enumeration include rwalld?
2008-09-22T15:13:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Ok.
2008-09-22T15:13:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,that doesn't mean it's not possible
2008-09-22T17:45:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,what was that for ?
2008-09-22T17:46:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I made a mistake when I organized my bookmarks. My apologies.
2008-09-22T17:46:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"ah, no problem"
2008-09-24T16:07:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,no authentication method advailable for advertising
2008-09-24T16:08:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Why do I need advertising?
2008-09-24T16:10:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,if things want to connect to it
2008-09-27T13:59:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"badblocks, or the vendor tools"
2008-09-27T13:59:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,badblocks
2008-09-27T13:59:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,yes
2008-09-27T14:00:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,My question was: 'Why?'
2008-09-27T14:00:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,incase you damage your disk
2008-09-27T14:01:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,There is a danger to damage my hard disk if I am using badblocks? Please elaborate.
2008-09-27T14:02:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,read about what it does and how it can try to fix things
2008-09-27T14:03:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,it's not a problem
2008-09-27T14:04:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I have read man badblocks. I cannot see why an analysis tool is a dangerous thing.
2008-09-27T14:04:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,read the important note
2008-09-28T12:44:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Yes I did. --  And did you read the question which I put here in this channel?
2008-09-28T12:42:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,did you read the important notice
2008-09-28T12:43:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,which one?
2008-09-28T12:43:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"the one that says 'don't run badblocks, let fsck manage it"
2008-09-28T12:45:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"if you want to be smart about it, I suggest you take it to a more appropriate channel as this is not an ubuntu question,"
2008-09-28T12:45:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"your persistantly asking generic linux questions, and you respond with smart responses to people trying to offer you advice/help"
2008-09-28T12:46:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,badblocks is a component of every recent Ubuntu distribution.
2008-09-28T12:47:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"yes, so it's generic"
2008-09-28T12:47:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,your not asking something specific to ubuntu
2008-09-28T12:47:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,and your attitude towards people helping you is getting tiresome
2008-10-05T13:51:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,please pelase stop asking generic linux questions in this channel
2008-10-05T13:51:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,you have been asked at least 10 times before
2008-10-05T13:51:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,please please - stop
2008-10-14T18:24:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,you said
2008-10-14T18:24:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"you can't repair sounds, you'll have to re-install them, but make sure they are not working and it's not just your media player/settings"
2008-10-14T19:13:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,I've explained what to do o
2008-10-14T19:20:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"out of interest does any other sounds play, say a random wav file or mp3"
2008-10-14T19:27:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"When I click on a .mp3 filename on the desktop, Rhythmbox will be called but there is no sound to be heard."
2008-10-14T19:27:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"ahh so it's not those sound files, it's your audio in general"
2008-10-14T19:28:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,'aplay /usr/share/sounds/startup.wav' functions. It produces a sound.
2008-10-14T19:28:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"ooh, so you know the files are ok then"
2008-10-20T14:04:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,can you paste your interfaces file please
2008-10-20T14:05:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,pastebin your interfaces file please.
2008-10-20T14:06:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,pastebin your interfaces file please.
2008-10-20T14:07:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,ActionParsnip: http://paste.ubuntuusers.de/392480/
2008-10-20T14:08:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,can you now please paste ifconfig -a please.
2008-10-20T14:10:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,http://paste.ubuntuusers.de/392481/
2008-10-20T14:11:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,if you look at your ifconfig -a output you have devices missing
2008-10-20T14:11:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"thats the problem, remove them from the interfaces file unless they appear in ifocnifg -a"
2008-10-20T14:31:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,ActionParsnip: Thank you for your help.
2008-10-21T14:27:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"perhaps modules you have manually specfied that are not part of the kernel, or thignsl ike the nvidia ones (just guessing)"
2008-10-21T14:40:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Your answer triggered me to examine the /etc/init.d/module-init-tools shell script's source text. 'Manual drivers' simply are all drivers stored in /etc/modules.
2008-10-21T14:40:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"so 'manually loaded' ones, that makes sense"
2008-10-22T13:46:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,kernel is not in multiverse or universe but the core repos
2008-10-22T13:48:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,/etc/apt/sources.list does not include a 'core' string. Where can I find 'core repos'?
2008-10-22T14:57:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,updates to the hardy packages
2008-10-22T15:02:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Why is it necessary to differentiate between hardy-updates and hardy proper in packages.ubuntu.com?
2008-10-22T15:02:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,so there is a base hardy - and updates made to that base hardy I assume
2008-10-22T15:03:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Hm.
2008-10-23T17:03:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,not an ubuntu question
2008-10-23T17:04:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,ALSA is no part of Ubuntu?
2008-10-23T17:04:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"yes, but alsa documentation and alsa it's self is nothing to do with ubuntu"
2008-10-23T17:04:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,ALSA and ubuntu are very well linked.
2008-10-23T17:05:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,no they are not
2008-10-23T17:05:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,alsa is nothing to do with ubuntu
2008-10-23T17:05:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,ubuntu uses alsa - thats it
2008-11-10T16:47:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,you know this is nothing to do with ubuntu
2008-11-10T16:47:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,STOP askign offtopic help
2008-11-14T19:02:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,you know this is english only channel

2008-12-22T13:10:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,check the gnome docs
2008-12-22T13:11:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"it's basiclly just the type of file it is, eg: normally based of the extension of the file"
2008-12-22T13:11:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,What do you mean by 'the' gnome docs? I do not know a collection that is comprehensive.

2008-12-22T13:13:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Thank you.
2008-12-22T16:48:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,is this really an ubuntu question ?
2008-12-22T16:48:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,It is in a file that Ubuntu provides.
2008-12-22T16:49:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,mime types are not defined by ubuntu
2008-12-29T16:09:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,is it a driver messages ?
2008-12-29T16:09:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,isn't it something to do with a wirless card kernel module
2008-12-29T16:11:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"It is a term related to networking, not necessarily to wireless."
2008-12-29T16:11:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"I thought 'rt' was a wirless kernel module,"
2008-12-29T16:12:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I do not know yet what 'rt' stands for.
2008-12-29T16:12:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,I think (reasonabley confident) it's a kernel module message for a wirless driver
2008-12-29T16:13:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"Ok, I will see if I understand the manpage better now."
2009-01-02T16:02:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,in what respect
2009-01-02T16:03:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I do not understand what that information this message conveys.
2009-01-02T16:03:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,what are doing
2009-01-02T16:04:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I am dispalying the most manpage.
2009-01-02T16:04:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I am displaying the most manpage.
2009-01-02T16:04:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,I'm not even aware of a command called most
2009-01-02T16:04:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,and that is quite generic linux - again not ubuntu
2009-01-02T16:05:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,It is package that Ubuntu provides.
2009-01-02T16:05:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,no - it is a generic command included in all linux distros
2009-01-03T16:01:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,come on !
2009-01-03T16:02:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,how many times do we go over this
2009-01-03T16:03:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"you KNOW this channel is gor ubuntu support only, not general linux support or software source development"
2009-01-03T16:03:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,please consider this a final warning
2009-01-09T13:56:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,/usr/share/men

2009-01-09T13:58:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Thank you.
2009-01-29T20:27:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"one is the real card, the other is a bridge to it"
2009-01-29T20:27:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Which one is the bridge?
2009-01-29T20:27:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,wifi0 I believe
2009-01-29T20:28:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,ath0 is the physical card
2009-01-29T20:28:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Ah! Thank you very much.
2009-01-30T02:00:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,I can't see a flag for hostname -d
2009-01-30T02:00:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I do not understand your message. I did not speak about any flag.
2009-01-30T02:00:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,-d is a flagf
2009-01-30T02:01:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,-d is the dns domain name
2009-01-30T02:01:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"Ah, I understand now. I would call that '-d' a switch."
2009-01-30T02:02:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"switch, thats fine too"
2009-02-03T17:38:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,what version of ubuntu are you using ?
2009-02-03T17:38:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Ubuntu 8.04.2.
2009-02-03T17:39:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"ahhh, never mind, I'd read about a bug in 8.10"
2009-02-11T17:13:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"come on, how is that 'ubuntu'"
2009-02-16T21:26:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,different files deleted from different gvfsd file systems ?
2009-02-16T21:27:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"Yes, this may have been the case. But I do not remember well."
2009-02-16T21:27:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"I'm only assuming,"
2009-02-16T21:28:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,kill the processes ?
2009-02-16T21:29:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I will kill them bravely.
2009-02-16T21:29:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,I would too
2009-02-16T21:33:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,hmw I killed 3 of them using System Monitor. They did not re-appear.
2009-02-16T21:33:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,seems a good sign
2009-02-26T13:43:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,evolution site E?
2009-02-26T13:43:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,evolution site ?
2009-02-26T13:44:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I will do some more snooping using your suggestion.
2009-02-26T16:13:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,is it packaged as an ubuntu package ?
2009-02-26T16:14:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I don't know that.
2009-02-26T16:14:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,worth checking
2009-02-26T16:25:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,the repo didn't install it or did you install from a 3rd party deb  ?
2009-02-26T16:27:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I do not understand your question. A repro is a copy of a painting or document. And I cannot decipher the meaning of the message.
2009-02-28T21:16:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,that is not an ubuntu issue
2009-03-20T14:36:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,what ar eyou trying to do ?
2009-03-20T14:36:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,which command ?
2009-03-20T14:36:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,The command 'net time'.
2009-03-20T14:37:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,ok - so net time is for use in a samba DOMAIN - is your machine part of a samba domain ?
2009-03-20T14:38:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"Yes, it is. This domain may not be functional at the moment as the other computer in the LAN is switched off though.)"
2009-03-20T14:39:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,thats why then
2009-03-20T14:39:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,it is querying the domain master for the time
2009-03-20T14:41:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"if you read the error message 'can't contact server' it is explaining it can't contact the server that gets time from (for what ever reason, it's turned off maybe)"
2009-03-20T14:42:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I will get informed what a Samba domain master is.
2009-03-20T14:42:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,the domain master is the server that is the 'domain controller' for your domaain
2009-03-20T14:42:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,how did you setup a domain without knowing what the domain master is ?
2009-03-20T14:43:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,You will not believe it: I managed to set up a functioning Samba domain. All myself.
2009-03-20T14:43:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,I do believe it - but I don't know how you can do that if you don't know what the domain master is  ?
2009-03-24T13:04:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,pastebin your lspci output
2009-03-24T13:06:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,http://paste.ubuntuusers.de/394574/
2009-03-24T13:08:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,very interesting
2009-03-24T13:08:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,the only thing I can think of is that either a.) the wrong audio module is being detected/loaded b.) the module descritption is wrong c.) bug in the gui
2009-03-24T13:10:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"Ok, I will enquire somewhat more."
2009-03-26T16:26:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"/etc/init.d/udev is a file, not a dir"
2009-03-26T16:26:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Yes. I made a mistake. A typo. I will re-word and re-transmit.
2009-03-26T16:27:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,thanks
2009-03-26T16:27:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,check the permissions on it ?
2009-03-26T16:28:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,on /etc/init.d/udev I mean to be clear
2009-03-26T16:28:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I used Nautilus and 'Search for files' as an ordinary user. Not as root.
2009-03-26T16:29:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,just curious to the permissions on it
2009-03-26T16:30:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,The permissions are root/root
2009-03-26T16:30:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"thats the owner, what's the permissions"
2009-03-26T16:32:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,':~$  ls -l /etc/init.d/udev; -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 2488 2008-04-11 14:21 /etc/init.d/udev'
2009-03-26T16:32:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,all looks pretty fine
2009-03-26T16:32:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,ahhh what about the permissions on /etc/init.d
2009-03-26T16:34:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,':~$ ls -l /etc/; drwxr-xr-x  2 root root     12288 2009-03-24 07:28 init.d'
2009-04-01T17:09:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,System > Administration does not show an 'Device Manager' entry in Ubuntu 8.04.

2009-04-01T17:11:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,system -> hardware something like that
2009-04-01T17:25:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"System > Control Center > Hardware > Sound opens the dialog 'Sound Preferences'. There exists a tab 'Devices' which allows me to select 'Devicess', among other things. In a way, one could call that a 'sound device manager' but I consider this rather remote. Can you comment."
2009-04-01T17:25:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,seems like the right application
2009-04-01T17:25:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"Ok, thank you."
2009-05-01T16:05:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"the fstab entry will tell your OS where to mount the file systems - nothing more, there is no intellegence behind it"
2009-05-01T16:10:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,The intelligence could be in the filesystem.
2009-05-01T16:10:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,there isn't any
2009-05-01T16:11:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,it's dumb - it does what you tell it
2009-05-01T16:11:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,hm
2009-05-20T17:59:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,you know the topic of this channel is ubuntu support - not channel finding help
2009-05-20T17:59:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,:-)
2009-07-02T12:11:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,enable your wirless card
2009-07-02T12:11:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,hehe. I just asked how to enable it.
2009-07-02T12:11:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,normally with a kill switch on the machine
2009-07-02T12:12:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,My computer does not have a hardware kill switch.
2009-07-02T12:12:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,is it a PC or a laptop
2009-07-02T12:12:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,It is a laptop computer.
2009-07-02T12:13:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,then it will either have a kill switch or a kill key sequence
2009-07-02T20:14:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,device up
2009-07-02T20:15:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Thank you.
2009-07-30T13:41:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,gdm settings maybe ?
2010-06-13T14:31:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,one is a script that calls the binary
2010-06-13T14:33:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,The process seamonkey-2.0 still exists. I cannot think of any reasonable reason to call a binary using a skript process that does not end immediately. Why did the process seamonkey-2.0 not terminate?
2010-06-13T14:34:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"it works the same in firefox, a script calls the binary"
2010-06-13T14:34:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Right.
2010-06-13T14:34:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,if you look you'll find the run-mozilla.sh still runs after firefox has started
2010-06-13T14:36:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I have no doubt that your statement is true.

2010-08-05T13:39:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,that's nothing to do with ubuntu
2010-08-05T13:39:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,extensions cacn mean anything you want
2010-08-05T13:41:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,hm
2010-08-28T13:21:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"you can tell any application to use it, it's just a mount point"
2010-08-28T13:21:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,nogo Thank you very much for your help.
2010-09-22T19:53:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,is that an ubuntu or a gnome question ?
2010-09-22T19:53:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,This is a Ubuntu question.
2010-09-22T19:53:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,whey did you prefix it with {GNOME}
2010-09-22T19:54:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,To narrow down the scope.
2010-10-12T00:46:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,that is in the dpkg and apt documentation
2010-10-12T00:47:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I will have a look into these 2 manual pages.
2010-10-12T00:54:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,it's in the documentation
2010-10-31T17:35:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,ask the guys in #openoffice.org
2010-10-31T17:36:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I beg your pardon?

2011-01-30T01:44:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"is partition 5 a logical container for logical partitions, or a logical partition"
2011-01-30T01:45:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,/dev/sda5 is a logical partition.
2011-01-30T01:45:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"are there any other logical partitions in it, or does it have a partent logical partition"
2011-01-30T01:47:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I do not know what a 'partent ligical partition' is. There are other logical partions on this computer: sda6 though 10.
2011-01-30T01:47:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,what is /dev/sda4 ?
2011-01-30T01:48:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,/dev/sda does not exist.
2011-01-30T01:48:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"I said /dev/sda4 !, not /dev/sda"

2011-01-30T01:54:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"ok the reason you can't delete sda5 is because sda5 is a container for sda6,7,8,9,10, none of those must be mounted or in use in any way if you wish to delete /dev/sda5"

2011-01-30T02:00:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,I read it wrong

2011-01-30T17:11:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,the reason you are having problems resizing is due to a lack of available space (unallocated) space on your disk
2011-01-30T17:30:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,How did you calculate that? 20.20 GiB are not allocated. I'd like to use them.
2011-01-30T17:30:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"look at the start/end cylinders, they are all allocated"
2011-01-30T17:32:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Between sda6 and sda7 3631 through 6267 are not allocated.
2011-01-30T17:33:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,but they are logical so they are contained in /dev/sda2 so 'allocated'
2011-01-30T17:36:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"I admit that thery are within /dev/sda2. But: This is not important. /dev/sda6 is also there. Still, I manged to move it."
2011-01-30T17:36:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"it is important, if you look at how the free space is laid out"
2011-01-30T17:38:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,/dev/sda2 allwed me to move partition sda6. So it should allow me to move the partition sda7 likewise.
2011-01-30T17:39:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,I disagree due to how the space is laid out. It may not hurt to re-read the partition table if you have done resizing so gparted knows it's current status
2011-01-30T17:40:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,The output of '~$ sudo fdisk -l' which I pasted is the current state. No upgrading needed.
2011-01-30T17:41:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"again, I disagree as gparted things there is no space free or none-readable. If you want advice, follow it, if you want to ignore it and argue it, good luck"
2011-01-30T17:42:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Thank you for advising.
2011-02-05T19:56:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,you'll need to follow the include's up the scripts
2011-02-05T19:58:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,This task is difficult to accomplish here as I cannot recognize a file (or script) hierarchy.
2011-02-05T19:59:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,why do you want to know then ?
2011-02-05T20:01:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Someone asked how he could determine how his Ubuntu computer was put back to work after sleeping.
2011-02-05T20:01:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"ok, so if you are unable to follow the script tree backwards as it is too hard, you won't be able to do this task"
2011-02-05T20:02:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,ok.
2011-03-17T16:40:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"it's the disk ID and partitoin for your system, X and Y are place holders that you swap out relevant to your system"
2011-03-17T16:57:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,why di dyou use update-manager -d ?
2011-03-17T16:57:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,did you intend to go to the development release?
2011-03-17T16:58:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Yes I did.
2011-03-17T16:58:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,then it's not supported and disscussion is in #ubuntu+1
2011-03-17T16:59:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,No. There is no diskcussion in #ubuntu+1.
2011-03-17T17:00:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"thats sad, but it's where the discussion for ubuntu 111.04 is, please join"
2011-03-17T17:00:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,11.04-pre-release is not a supported distro
2011-03-17T17:00:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,at their systems that they use to type messaages
2011-03-17T17:02:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,it's been explained to you please join #ubuntu+1
2011-04-12T16:54:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,the output of ps -ef shows the parent id for each process
2011-04-12T16:56:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Thank you very much for your help.
2011-05-16T17:43:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,because it's not in your locate cache path
2011-05-16T17:44:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,also there is no extension on that file
2011-05-16T17:44:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,'in addition'
2011-05-16T17:46:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"database is not a file name for mysql, database.blah is"
2011-05-16T17:46:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"so a.) the path of the file would need to be in your locate cache path b.) you need to specify the full file name, eg: mydatabase.mdf"
2011-05-16T17:48:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"they are files, but you need to specify the extension"
2011-05-29T19:34:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,#openoffice.org
2011-05-29T19:40:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I know #ubuntuoffice.org. Do you?
2011-05-29T19:40:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"I don't know that channel, only #openoffice.org"
2011-05-29T19:40:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I know #openoffice.org. Do you?
2011-05-29T19:40:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"yes, that's why I asked you to take you're question to the channel"
2011-05-29T19:47:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,The DEB program package openoffice.org-base has even the word 'ubuntu' in its installed version number: 1.3.3.0-7ubuntu4.2. And you are telling me that this does not belong to Ubuntu.
2011-05-29T19:47:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,I'm telling you learning how to use openoffice would be better served in #openoffice.org
2011-05-29T19:52:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"no, it's not"
2011-05-29T19:52:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"sorry, not you"

2011-06-08T18:47:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Thank you.
2011-06-13T01:34:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,pardon ?
2011-06-13T01:35:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,How should I interpret this Ubuntu installer message?
2011-06-13T01:39:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,it's pretty much saying 'ready when you are'
2011-06-13T01:45:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Thank you for your help.
2011-06-16T13:24:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,it's a system binding
2011-06-16T13:24:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Can you elaborate.
2011-06-16T13:25:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,no
2011-06-16T21:13:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,press F12 and find out
2011-06-16T21:14:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Your message is not helpful.
2011-06-16T21:14:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"it is, press F12 and find out what it does, it won't be anything dangerous"
2011-06-17T14:11:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"later version, enchancments ?"
2011-06-23T16:03:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"I believe the kernel source package contains the documentation, if by documentation you mean the README for that kernel"
2011-06-23T16:05:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Thank you.
2011-07-01T12:50:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,Xorg
2011-07-01T13:07:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Your answer is wrong. On my Ubuntu 11.04 is no Xorg running but .xsession-errors is not empty.
2011-07-01T13:08:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,my answer is not wrong
2011-07-01T13:09:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Reiterating is no help. You need to prove your statement.
2011-07-01T13:09:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"no, I don't you need to read the documentation on it"
2011-07-01T13:09:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,:-)
2011-07-01T17:00:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,ask the guys in gnome -
2011-07-01T17:00:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I did.
2011-07-01T17:01:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"ok - so it's not an ubuntu question, as you know"
2011-07-09T14:36:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,that's the default file to use
2011-07-09T14:37:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"well, it does, as unless you have changed it to not use the default file - it will use the default file"
2011-07-09T14:37:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,That is correct.
2011-07-09T14:38:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,so there is your answer
2011-07-09T14:38:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Thank you.
2011-07-10T15:00:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,do a search for redirect.log
2011-07-10T15:00:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"I'd guess /var/log somewhere, but it could also be in your home dir"
2011-07-10T15:01:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,'~$ locate redirect.log' does not produce any output.
2011-07-10T15:02:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,looking at the man page --redirect.log is not a valid option
2011-07-10T15:02:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/natty/man1/banshee.1.html
2011-07-10T15:04:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"I consulted the manpage before I posted here. --redirect log is not listed there as an option. Still, the GNOME menu uses this option. I believe that the manpage is outdated. It is dated 2009."
2011-07-10T15:05:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"well, I don't believe it is,"
2011-07-10T15:05:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,do banshee --help
2011-07-10T15:05:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,do you see the option?
2011-07-10T15:06:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I do not see the option. But --help does not list all options.
2011-07-10T15:07:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"so the man page doesn't list it, --help doesn't list it, and the command doesn't appear to work, so that to me suggests it's not a valid option"
2011-07-10T15:07:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"or the option isn't doing what you expect it to do, eg: it's actually not a log file redirector"
2011-07-10T15:07:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"Yes, this may be an explanation. --  Thank you."
2011-07-16T19:32:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"if you look in the gnome docs, it will be the default location"
2011-09-09T22:16:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,have you installed it ?
2011-09-09T22:17:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,have you looked in the repos ?
2011-09-15T19:22:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,should be
2011-09-15T19:23:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Thank you.
2011-09-15T19:24:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,that doesn't not contain the 'mail' command
2011-09-17T11:58:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,what daily build number ?
2011-09-17T12:01:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,The one that is referred to here: http://www.mail-archive.com/kvm@vger.kernel.org/msg22945.html
2011-09-17T12:01:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,what version of ubuntu are you running ?
2011-09-19T13:29:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,as always a quick google is your friend http://code.google.com/p/eiskaltdc/
2011-09-19T13:30:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Thank you for your help.
2011-12-20T02:38:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,why does it matter ?
2011-12-20T02:38:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,it's a file name
2011-12-20T17:06:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,could you rephrase the question as it doesn't make sense
2011-12-20T17:07:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,maybe give a real world example in a pastebin if it helps
2011-12-20T18:38:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,it filters results normally
2011-12-20T18:39:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,'normally' is no useful description for an instruction for use.
2011-12-20T18:39:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,ok then 'read the documentation' that should give you a useful description
2012-01-25T14:18:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,not an ubuntu issue
2012-01-25T15:59:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,ok ?
2012-01-25T16:00:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Your message is too short to be comprehensible.
2012-01-25T16:00:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,your message had no question to it
2012-01-25T16:01:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,My message has a question mark at its end. Therefore it is a question.
2012-01-25T16:02:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,are you actually asking why the wording / description has changed ?
2012-01-25T16:03:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I am asking why Ubuntu 11.10 Synaptic does not attach the same notice to that package as Ubuntu Synaptic did before.
2012-01-25T16:03:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,because it's a different version of the package ?
2012-01-25T16:04:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,No. It is the same version.
2012-01-25T16:04:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"you'll have to contact the package maintainer to find out why he has changed the text in the description field, only he can tell you that"
2012-01-25T16:04:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"it doesn't really matter, it's an ubuntu package, coming from the ubuntu repos, so the validity of the package is still the same"
2012-01-25T16:05:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,'I see your point. --  Thank you.
2012-01-25T21:34:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,you can also look in the password file
2012-01-30T16:06:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,sounds like a bug
2012-01-30T16:09:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I suspected that too.
2012-02-04T19:59:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"look at what that shortkey key does, see if the file it's calling is there"
2012-02-04T20:00:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,What 'shortkey' do you mean?
2012-02-04T20:00:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,'super-key -> epihany'
2012-02-04T20:02:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,"This is no shortkey. Tthis is the normal GNOME Shell way to call an application program, in my case the application 'Epiphany'. And indeed, the Epiphany symbol appears."
2012-02-04T20:02:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,ok - so look at what that icon links to
2012-02-04T20:03:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,or launch it manually and work it through
2012-02-10T15:29:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,where are you getting that message ?
2012-02-10T15:30:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,where are you getting that message ?
2012-02-10T15:30:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"is this question an ubuntu support issue, or a generic kernel question ?"
2012-02-10T15:30:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I am referring to an actual Ubuntu program-
2012-02-10T15:31:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,which ubuntu program ?
2012-02-10T15:32:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,The name of the Ubuntu program is 'poweroff'.
2012-02-10T15:32:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,how do you launch it
2012-02-10T15:32:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,as from what you are saying you are reading the power off function in the kernel
2012-02-10T15:33:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,could you please clarify
2012-02-10T15:33:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,'[11:32] <ikonia> bullgard4: how do you launch it' <- Please read 'man poweroff' for an answer.
2012-02-10T15:33:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"no, I'm asking you"
2012-02-10T15:34:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"if you want help - respond to questions, don't tell me to read the man pages"
2012-02-10T15:35:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I have used the program 'poweroff' in the command '~$ sudo poweroff'.
2012-02-10T15:35:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,ok - if you look that's actually a symlink
2012-02-10T15:36:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,what is your actual questions
2012-02-10T15:36:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Your message does not answer my question at the outset.
2012-02-10T15:36:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,because you have not asked a question
2012-02-10T15:36:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,or at least one that is clear
2012-02-10T15:36:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,I know that well. And It does not answer the question which I put at the outset.
2012-02-10T15:36:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,so if you have an ubuntu specific support question please ask
2012-02-10T15:37:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,Please read what I wrote bewfore and take notice and try to understand the meaning in it.
2012-02-10T15:37:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,"it doesn't make sense, which is why I'm asking you to clarify your question"
2012-02-10T15:42:00.000Z,bullgard4,ikonia,It does not make sense asking for the meaning of a term that is used in a Ubuntu-made source ccode? Oh dear.
2012-02-10T15:42:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,it is NOT ubuntu made source code
2012-02-10T15:48:00.000Z,ikonia,bullgard4,please check your private messages
