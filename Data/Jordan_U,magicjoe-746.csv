2010-11-22T00:48:00.000Z,magicjoe,,ANYONE: know anything abut Wubi?
2010-11-22T00:48:00.000Z,magicjoe,,sorry
2010-11-22T00:50:00.000Z,magicjoe,,"ok, sorry, let me clarify. I have a wubi installation on an xp maching. everything was working fine, until, i just now did an update. it froze up in the middle of that. so i had to manually restart the computer. when i try to boot up now, i only have windows in grub"
2010-11-22T00:50:00.000Z,magicjoe,,any way to get that back?
2010-11-22T00:52:00.000Z,magicjoe,,"basically i have a folder in xp called ubuntu, and it has large files that are my ubuntu installation, but there is a folder called boot, which has a folder called grub, which is now empty. can i rebuild a 'grub' file in windows through notepad, that will bring this partition back alive?"
2010-11-22T00:53:00.000Z,magicjoe,,"or basically , i screwed the pooch?"
2010-11-22T00:54:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,You should be able to just add this to your boot.ini (add a new line to the end of the file):        c:\wubildr.mbr='Ubuntu'
2010-11-22T01:01:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,You should be able to just add this to your boot.ini (add a new line to the end of the file):        c:\wubildr.mbr='Ubuntu'
2010-11-22T01:02:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"so if that ini file is gone, can i create that in notepad, and add that line in? or do i need more data than that line?"
2010-11-22T01:07:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"To edit the boot.ini, 1: Right-click My Computer, and then click Properties. 2: On the Advanced tab, click Settings under Startup and Recovery."
2010-11-22T01:07:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"3: Under System Startup, click Edit.  (from http://support.microsoft.com/kb/289022 )"
2010-11-22T01:08:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,that line is in that file from the instructions you just gave me.
2010-11-22T01:09:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,I have a Wubi installation. so thats what the difference is
2010-11-22T01:10:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"I created a blank file, with that line in it, and put it into the boot/grub folder in the dir created by the wubi installer. hoping that will solve on reboot"
2010-11-22T01:10:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"called it boot.ini, and added the line you told me to put in."
2010-11-22T01:10:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"boot.ini is a windows configuration file, it's not contained in boot/grub or any wubi specific directory. It's in the root of the partition (but it's hidden and read only by default, so follow the instructions I gave to open it)."
2010-11-22T01:11:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,i did that and the line was already there.
2010-11-22T01:12:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,I guess what i need then is what do i need to put into the boot/grub folder under the wubi directory to get the ubuntu option back when i boot up?
2010-11-22T01:13:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"thats why im backing up the .disk files with all my settings and whatnot, then will reinstall wubi and replace the default .disk files with my old ones."
2010-11-22T01:13:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Odd. Can you take a picture of the menu(s) you see at boot?
2010-11-22T01:13:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"sigh. no. it happened because i was updating, and it froze"
2010-11-22T01:14:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,No to what? You can't take a picture of the menus you see at boot?
2010-11-22T01:14:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,i get the windows xp or Ubuntu
2010-11-22T01:15:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"when i click ubuntu, there is no linux option in the grub loader"
2010-11-22T01:15:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Ok. Can you boot an Ubuntu LiveCD?
2010-11-22T01:15:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"the updates removed a lot of the files, and was going to install new files, but froze up. i had to hard restart"
2010-11-22T01:16:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,I have Helix 3
2010-11-22T01:16:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"That's a problem within the root.dsk file, so re-installing won't help."
2010-11-22T01:16:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,so is there a fix for this?
2010-11-22T01:17:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"Yes, but it's hard to fix from within windows."
2010-11-22T01:17:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"well, i have helix 3. its forensics tools built on ubuntu....will that work?"
2010-11-22T01:17:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Yes.
2010-11-22T01:18:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"ok, so im going to boot up to that, and then you can help me fix my wubi?"
2010-11-22T01:18:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Yes.
2010-11-22T01:19:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,thank you for this. booting up now
2010-11-22T01:20:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,You're welcome.
2010-11-22T01:20:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,can i go smoke a cig real quick while this reboots?
2010-11-22T01:20:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"im talking to you on my laptop, my desktop has the problem"
2010-11-22T01:21:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,I'm not going to stop you (and I will still be here when you get back :)
2010-11-22T01:21:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,thanks again. brb. helix is loading
2010-11-22T01:24:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"back. thanks again for your patience and time, and help. helix is up and running"
2010-11-22T01:25:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Do you know how to mount partitions and how to loop mount files?
2010-11-22T01:26:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"sort of. i am a noob, but have taken linux classes in college. i catch on quick. i have a terminal open, and have su to root"
2010-11-22T01:27:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,my windows partition is mounted
2010-11-22T01:27:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Can you pastebin the output of 'blkid'?
2010-11-22T01:27:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"i cant past it to here because this is my laptop, and the wubi is on my destop, but i can type in what it says...let me run that"
2010-11-22T01:28:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,If you've already mounted your windows partition (and you know the mount point) then I don't need that output.
2010-11-22T01:29:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,yeah its dev/hda1
2010-11-22T01:31:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,are you there?
2010-11-22T01:31:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Yes.
2010-11-22T01:31:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,ok just checking. what do i do now? lol
2010-11-22T01:32:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,To mount your wubi root.disk run 'mount -o loop /mountpoint/ubuntu/disks/root.disk /mnt/'.
2010-11-22T01:33:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,do that verbatim or substitube mountpoint with the actual mountpoint?
2010-11-22T01:33:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Substitute mountpoint.
2010-11-22T01:35:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"/dev/hdb5 is not a mountpoint, it's a device node."
2010-11-22T01:36:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Run 'mount' to find where /dev/hdb5 is mounted.
2010-11-22T01:36:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,media/hdb5?
2010-11-22T01:37:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,that is doing something
2010-11-22T01:38:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"command accepted with no error message, hard drive is spinning.....cursor in terminal is just blinking on a blank line now"
2010-11-22T01:39:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"hd stopped spinning, cursor still blinking on blank line.....nothing happening"
2010-11-22T01:41:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"i don't know what to do next? nothing happened on that command, the cursor went to another line, and blinks....nothing going on."
2010-11-22T01:42:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Does pressing ctrl+D do anything?
2010-11-22T01:42:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,hd starts spinning again
2010-11-22T01:44:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,and nothing.....
2010-11-22T01:44:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"No idea. The output of 'dmesg' (in another terminal) would be usefull, but it's too much to type out manually. Can you connect to the internet or transfer the output via flash drive to a computer that can?"
2010-11-22T01:46:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,many many lines of 'failed to read'
2010-11-22T01:47:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,it connects to the internet
2010-11-22T01:48:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,im confused? pastebin?
2010-11-22T01:48:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"oh the first command finally finished, and its says unknown filesystem type ext4"
2010-11-22T01:49:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,You're liveCD is too old then.
2010-11-22T01:51:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,How old are they?
2010-11-22T01:51:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"sleuth is old, but the live cd i created from an existing installation is pretty new, its karmic not lucid"
2010-11-22T01:52:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Karmic should have ext4 support.
2010-11-22T01:54:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,booting up the live cd created from existing karmic installation
2010-11-22T01:56:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,oh man.....my monitor is saying cannot display video
2010-11-22T01:57:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"oh nope, sorry. patience is a virtue, looks like up"
2010-11-22T01:58:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"it ended up going to a command prompt, and i ran startx to get into the gui"
2010-11-22T02:01:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"desktop is loading......slowly. but i see the background, status bars are coming soon, i hope"
2010-11-22T02:02:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,I'll be back in about 10 minutes.
2010-11-22T02:03:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"ok, my desktop should be up by then. status bars are showing up, icons not loaded yet."
2010-11-22T02:03:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,i really appreciate your help.
2010-11-22T02:13:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,u back yet?
2010-11-22T02:16:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,are you back?
2010-11-22T02:23:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"are you back yet? please, i need help"
2010-11-22T02:25:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"i have my live cd running, only at command prompt. mount command does not list my dev/hda5 partition anywhere"
2010-11-22T02:37:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Sorry it took longer than I expected. I'm back now.
2010-11-22T02:38:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"i have the live cd up in command prompt, as root. the 'mount' command does not list the partition with wubi"
2010-11-22T02:40:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Run 'mkdir /media/windows' then 'mount /dev/sdXY /media/windows' (replacing 'XY' with the proper values from blkid).
2010-11-22T02:41:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,DONE
2010-11-22T02:42:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,now mount that?
2010-11-22T02:43:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Now run 'mkdir /media/wubi/' then  'mount -o loop /media/windows/ubuntu/disks/root.disk /media/wubi/'.
2010-11-22T02:44:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,done
2010-11-22T02:45:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Now run 'mount --bind /proc/ /media/wubi/proc; mount --bind /dev/ /media/wubi/dev/; mount --bind /sys/ /media/wubi/sys/'.
2010-11-22T02:47:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"error messages.....mount point media/wubi/proc does not exsist, same for /dev and /sys....with the same beginning"
2010-11-22T02:48:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,need to create those mount points first?
2010-11-22T02:48:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,how do i do that?
2010-11-22T02:49:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Those directories should already exist.
2010-11-22T02:49:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"they exist, but the mount points don't exist on this live cd, its from another system"
2010-11-22T02:50:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,/dev /proc and /sys don't exist in the LiveCD environment?
2010-11-22T02:50:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"just need the command to add mount points for those directories, then the binds should work"
2010-11-22T02:51:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,i mean '/media/wubi/proc' '/media/wibi/dev' and '/media/wubi/sys' do not exist on the live cd
2010-11-22T02:52:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Then something is wrong.
2010-11-22T02:53:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,What is the ouput of 'mount'?
2010-11-22T02:53:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"LOL thats what i mean....i was updating, and it froze, the updates removed a lot of stuff, and then didnt get to install the replacements"
2010-11-22T02:54:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,I find it hard to believe that an update would remove any of those directories.
2010-11-22T02:55:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,i have a bunch of lines that say none on /sys/kernel.... and then the last 2 lines say /dev/sdb5 on /media/windows type vfat (rw)
2010-11-22T02:55:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,and dev/loop1 on /mnt type ext4 (rw)
2010-11-22T02:56:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,can u just tell me the command to create these mnt points? and i will try to run the bind command again...? just humor me
2010-11-22T02:56:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,No.
2010-11-22T02:57:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,no?
2010-11-22T02:57:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"You mounted to /mnt/, I said to mount to /media/wubi. That's what's causing the problem."
2010-11-22T02:57:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,ok so what do i do?
2010-11-22T02:58:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,sorry. please help me get this right. i thought i typed in exactly what you told me to
2010-11-22T02:59:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,i did mkdir /media/wubi
2010-11-22T03:00:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Run 'mount --bind /proc/ /mnt/proc; mount --bind /dev/ /mnt/dev/; mount --bind /sys/ /mnt/sys/'.
2010-11-22T03:01:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,mount point /mnt/dev does not exsist
2010-11-22T03:01:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,mkdir /mnt/dev?
2010-11-22T03:03:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,No.
2010-11-22T03:04:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,ok....
2010-11-22T03:04:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Let's try mounting the root.disk again. Run 'sudo umount /mnt/' then 'mount -o loop /media/windows/ubuntu/disks/root.disk /media/wubi/'.
2010-11-22T03:05:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,DONE
2010-11-22T03:06:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,now the bind command again?
2010-11-22T03:06:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"Ok, now please run 'mount' and pastebin the full output. It would help if you could connect this machine to the internet and pastebin directly from there."
2010-11-22T03:06:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,i am unfamiliar with pastebin
2010-11-22T03:07:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,i ran the command....what exactly are we looking for?
2010-11-22T03:08:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,i don't follow? so i run the pastebin command? and what URL?
2010-11-22T03:10:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,command not found pastebin
2010-11-22T03:10:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"i can see the whole output of that command, i just cant upload it. what do you need to know?"
2010-11-22T03:12:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,ok just did aptget on pastebinit
2010-11-22T03:12:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,so now you want mount | pastebinit?

2010-11-22T03:24:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Yes.
2010-11-22T03:24:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,I will seriously send you money if you can get my wubi back!
2010-11-22T03:26:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,i am back
2010-11-22T03:27:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,did i do the pastebin correctly? and does that help?
2010-11-22T03:27:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Yes and yes.
2010-11-22T03:28:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Run 'umount /mnt/' then 'mount -o loop /media/windows/ubuntu/disks/root.disk /media/wubi/' then run 'mount | pastebinit' and give the URL.
2010-11-22T03:28:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,sweet. sorry to be a nuisance. you really are a great soul for doing this. THANK you again. i really will send you money if you get this going for me.
2010-11-22T03:29:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,the umount says device is busy!
2010-11-22T03:30:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Try running 'cd' first.
2010-11-22T03:31:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,can i force this to quit?
2010-11-22T03:31:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,still says buys
2010-11-22T03:32:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Try 'fuser -k /mnt/'
2010-11-22T03:33:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"that was successful, don't know what it did"
2010-11-22T03:33:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,It killed any processes with open files in /mnt/. Now try 'umount /mnt/' again (if you haven't already).
2010-11-22T03:34:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,still buys
2010-11-22T03:34:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,still busy i mean
2010-11-22T03:35:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Run 'umount /mnt/dev/; umount /mnt/proc/; umount /mnt/sys/; umount /mnt/'
2010-11-22T03:36:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,mnt/dev not mounted /mnt still busy
2010-11-22T03:37:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Did you forget the leading '/' in 'umount /mnt/dev/'?
2010-11-22T03:37:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,nope i put in all the slashes you put in
2010-11-22T03:38:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Try running 'sudo umount -a'.
2010-11-22T03:39:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,ok mnt is no longer mounted!
2010-11-22T03:40:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,now the loop command?
2010-11-22T03:40:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"Ok. Now run 'mount /dev/sdXY /media/windows/' (again, replacing XY with the proper values)."
2010-11-22T03:41:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,done
2010-11-22T03:42:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Now run 'mount -o loop /media/windows/ubuntu/disks/root.disk /media/wubi/'
2010-11-22T03:42:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,DONE
2010-11-22T03:43:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"Now run 'mkdir /media/wubi/media/windows/' (I know that seems odd, but I mean exactly what I typed)."
2010-11-22T03:44:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U, DONE
2010-11-22T03:45:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Now run 'mount --bind /media/windows/ /media/wubi/media/windows/'. Then run 'mount | pastebinit' and give the URL.

2010-11-22T03:47:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"Not that it should be a problem, but did you really install XP to a fat32 partition rather than ntfs?"
2010-11-22T03:48:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,no its ntfs that is just a data partition that was shared on linux and xp
2010-11-22T03:49:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"the NEWSHARE partition is where wubi is at, but it worked fine"
2010-11-22T03:50:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"i mean, the windows is installed on an ntfs partition, but the newshare partition is fat, used for data files that are shared on both OSs"
2010-11-22T03:50:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,and that wubi is installed on the newshare partition
2010-11-22T03:50:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,hope that makes sense
2010-11-22T03:51:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"Ahh, installing wubi to a separate partition from 'C:' is probably the root cause of the problem. Wubi is currently embarassingly bad at dealing with being installed to a different partition than 'C:'. You are lucky you're still able to boot windows in fact."
2010-11-22T03:52:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"it was working fine forever, with no problems. it only started today when i ran updates, and it froze up"
2010-11-22T03:53:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"We'll continue with what I was planning to do, but there may be additional problems I wasn't expecting because it's a separate partition."

2010-11-22T03:57:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,is there a slash after the second proc?
2010-11-22T03:57:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"It works with or without the '/'. But yes, I meant to have one."

2010-11-22T04:00:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,NOOOOO
2010-11-22T04:00:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,there is no way to do this fix on a 32 bit system?
2010-11-22T04:00:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,You can fix it. You'll just have to edit the grub.cfg manually instead of using update-grub.
2010-11-22T04:01:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"can you PLEASE help me do that?  when i booted to windows, i saw the /ubuntu/boot/grub directory, but there was nothing in that. how do i get the grub back???"
2010-11-22T04:04:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,how can i update the .cfg file?
2010-11-22T04:04:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"Just wait, it takes a while to write an explanation :)"
2010-11-22T04:04:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,ok sorry.

2010-11-22T04:10:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,like un-fixable problems?
2010-11-22T04:10:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,No. Just annoying and tedious :)
2010-11-22T04:11:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"i truly will pay you for helping me. im on a college student budget, but i can make installments. i mean, like 100 bucks? in installments, or like 50 or so?"

2010-11-22T04:18:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,and my settings will still be there? hopefully?
2010-11-22T04:18:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Yes.
2010-11-22T04:19:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"ok, worth a shot. so how do i obtain this image, and what do i do with it? lol, im sure you are typing instructions right now, so i will wait"
2010-11-22T04:25:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,You still there?
2010-11-22T04:27:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,Please tell me you are there?
2010-11-22T04:28:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,I am. It's just taking a while to make the modifications needed for things to work on your setup.
2010-11-22T04:28:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,ok awesome.
2010-11-22T04:32:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Ok. Run 'sudo mv /media/wubi/boot/ /media/wubi/boot-broken/'.

2010-11-22T04:38:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,saving!
2010-11-22T04:38:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,now i want to mention one thing.....
2010-11-22T04:39:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"the live cd i am running was 64 bit, from comp at school...my desktop with wubi, i don't think is 64 bit...."
2010-11-22T04:39:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"were you looking at the stuff from the live cd instance of linux, or the wubi, and windows specs?"
2010-11-22T04:40:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,You shouldn't have had a problem chrooting into a 32 bit system from a 64 bit liveCD.
2010-11-22T04:40:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"ok, you know more than i do....ill trust your word"
2010-11-22T04:40:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,What is the output of 'uname -m'?
2010-11-22T04:40:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"15%, slowly but surely"
2010-11-22T04:41:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"cant do that yet, waiting for the dl of your file"
2010-11-22T04:44:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,30% and ticking.....
2010-11-22T04:48:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,38%......dang! i will run teh uname -m when its done
2010-11-22T04:48:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,taking another smoke break while this downloads.
2010-11-22T04:54:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,60%.....for 15MB this is taking a while!
2010-11-22T04:55:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,I'm using 3G wireless for internet access because my main connection died due to snow. That's why it's so slow.
2010-11-22T04:56:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"its ok, i can live....there is activity so thats a good sign! :)"
2010-11-22T05:06:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,96% less than a minute!!!
2010-11-22T05:08:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,OK and we are good!!! Now what?
2010-11-22T05:10:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Run 'tar -C /media/wubi/ -xf /media/wubi/boot_dir.tar.gz'.
2010-11-22T05:10:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,After running that you should now have a /media/wubi/boot/ with kernel images in it.
2010-11-22T05:11:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,And could you now tell me the output of 'uname -m'?
2010-11-22T05:11:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,i686
2010-11-22T05:12:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,and how do i verify the kernel is there?
2010-11-22T05:12:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"That's 32 bit, 64 bit would be 'x86_64'."
2010-11-22T05:12:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,yeah but didn't you just give me a 64 bit one?
2010-11-22T05:13:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"The liveCD you're using is 32 bit, your wubi installation is 64 bit."
2010-11-22T05:13:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,OK. so what should i do now? just reboot it?
2010-11-22T05:13:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Yes.
2010-11-22T05:15:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,whats the command to make it spit out my cd and restart?
2010-11-22T05:15:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,'reboot'
2010-11-22T05:19:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,well the kernel was there in the grub list! looks good so far!
2010-11-22T05:19:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,wait! ok mount mount point /dev/shm does not exist
2010-11-22T05:20:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,control D will terminate this shell give root password for maintenance
2010-11-22T05:21:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"and a bunch of failed mountall commands, and and inti status 4, fsck from util-linux-ng 2.16 mount of root file system failed"
2010-11-22T05:22:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"at the end is says in parentheses or type control d to continue: dev/loop0: clean, 11746/256000 files, 194557/1024000 blocks"
2010-11-22T05:22:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Try pressing ctrl+D.
2010-11-22T05:23:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,it restarted the box
2010-11-22T05:23:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,should i try recovery mode?
2010-11-22T05:24:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Yes. It probably won't boot either but it can't hurt to try.
2010-11-22T05:24:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"so, im screwed? :("
2010-11-22T05:26:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"WAIT! if i can get to the /etc and back all of that up to my ext hd, can i just run wubi again, and then overwrite with my backed up etc to the /etc? wont that save my settings for everything???"
2010-11-22T05:26:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,recovery did the same thing by the way
2010-11-22T05:27:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"I think the problem is that the initrd images I gave you are made to boot from an ntfs partition, and don't have fat32 support."
2010-11-22T05:28:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"well, in the grub, i see a VISTA loader option..... that tells me, maybe you got the specs from the pc that the live cd was made on....not the specs of my pc that has the wubi."
2010-11-22T05:28:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"because i don't have vista on this pc at all, never have. but the school pc i made the live cd on was running vista"
2010-11-22T05:28:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,The windows entry won't work on your machine.
2010-11-22T05:29:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"No, that's from the test VM I grabbed the /boot/ directory from."
2010-11-22T05:29:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"well i know that won't but this kernel isn't either....so im just asking/guessing that this whatever that is listed in grub that says linux, is meant for the OTHER pc"
2010-11-22T05:30:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,ok.... so is this give up and start over time? or is there anything we can do from the command line (i can get to it from here without live cd) and fix it?
2010-11-22T05:31:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"It is, and that's the problem. I'm trying to see if I can rebuild the initrd with vfat support now. If that fails, you should be still be able to backup your current root.disk, re-install wubi, then copy /boot/ from the new root.disk to the old one, and restore the old root.disk."
2010-11-22T05:31:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,was my /etc idea any good or worth trying?
2010-11-22T05:33:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"ok, but i don't follow.....the file is just an image the root.disk, so how can i copy the boot thingy? oh live cd again? and whatnot?"
2010-11-22T05:33:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,why didnt we just try that from the start? lol
2010-11-22T05:34:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,I didn't realize the extent of the problem at the start :)
2010-11-22T05:35:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"if you are up for it, i propose we go that route from here on out. shouldn't be hard to mount the ex hd, and the root.disk file, then copy what i need, then i can just do the wubi, on my own, and basically reverse the steps you teach me ?"
2010-11-22T05:36:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"then you can email me a way to pay you. but i can get the bulk of it done now, and reach a stopping point for the day, but still have a possible solution"
2010-11-22T05:38:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,I'm curious if my updated initrd will work. If you don't mind trying one last thing before going the other route.
2010-11-22T05:39:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,ok....i booted to the live cd...is that what i need to do?
2010-11-22T05:41:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,im at command prompt in the live cd again
2010-11-22T05:41:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Yes. Run 'mkdir /media/windows; mkdir /media/wubi/; mount /dev/sdb5 /media/windows/; mount -o loop /media/windows/ubuntu/disks/root.disk /media/wubi/'.
2010-11-22T05:48:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,OK did that!
2010-11-22T05:48:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Now run 'cd /media/wubi/boot/ && mv initrd.img-2.6.35-22-generic initrd.img-2.6.35-22-generic-bad && wget http://jordanu.dyndns.org/initrd.img-2.6.35-22-generic'
2010-11-22T05:52:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"OK must have done that right, its downloading"
2010-11-22T05:54:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"That's odd, because according to my network statistics and apache logs you don't appear to be downloading anything from me."
2010-11-22T05:55:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,it says jordanu.dyndns.org and an ipaddress on port 80! 28k/s!!!
2010-11-22T05:55:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,NOW 48k/s!!!
2010-11-22T05:56:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,60% but slowed to 5k/s
2010-11-22T05:58:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,I wasn't seeing the upload because my network applet is apparently just not working at the moment. I see it now.
2010-11-22T05:58:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,much faster speed!
2010-11-22T06:00:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,OK done!!!
2010-11-22T06:00:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Try rebooting. If it fails this time then just backup your root.disk and start re-installing.
2010-11-22T06:01:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U," if this fails, i need ur help to backup that thing ur talking about"
2010-11-22T06:02:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"kernel panic, not syncing vfs unable to mount root fs on unknown block 0,0"
2010-11-22T06:04:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"Ok, back to the drawing board! so, can u just help me mount my ext hd, backup what i need to, then just tell me how to replace it later"
2010-11-22T06:04:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Ok. To backup the root.disk simply copy it (or move it) from C:\ubuntu\disks\root.disk to anywhere outside of the Ubuntu directory (your desktop will work).
2010-11-22T06:05:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,so i don't need to go back to the live cd? and mount the ext hd?
2010-11-22T06:06:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"No, you can do it from within windows."
2010-11-22T06:06:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,i need to be able to mount the image to extract the boot part of the root.disk file though right?
2010-11-22T06:07:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Yes.
2010-11-22T06:07:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"ok, so you are saying do this all from windows? i just want to know what im doing lol"
2010-11-22T06:07:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Backup the root.disk and re-install wubi within windows. Then we can copy the /boot directory over between the images from the LiveCD.
2010-11-22T06:07:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"while i have the live cd at root command prompt, is there anything we need to do NOW?"
2010-11-22T06:08:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"ok gotcha, rebooting"
2010-11-22T06:18:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"OK, so root.disk is on my desktop, but the uninstaller does nothing when i double click it!"
2010-11-22T06:18:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,trying through control panel now
2010-11-22T06:20:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"NOPE even in control panel, if i try to uninstall wubi, it says do not have access to F:\ubuntu\uninstall-wubi.exe"
2010-11-22T06:21:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,do i just delete the files? or just run the installer again?
2010-11-22T06:24:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"Answered that myself lol....just deleted the directory, and now running installer.....root.disk is on desktop......all good?"
2010-11-22T06:24:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,It may not think wubi is installed since there's no root.disk. Try creating a file named root.disk in ubuntu\disks\.
2010-11-22T06:25:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,I don't know what will happen if you re-install without uninstalling first.
2010-11-22T06:25:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"the file was still there, i only copied it to desktop.....it was somethin else totally.....im risking it!"
2010-11-22T06:26:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"at this point its the last hope. if this doesnt work, i will thank you for your time and call it a day. i have a paper to write, due tomorrow, and my girlfriend has been wanting me to come over since 230"
2010-11-22T06:27:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"if this works, i will just have to reinstall the whole thing from scratch. and get my compiz and all that setup, and my cairo-dock, its terrible. that will be an all day thing, next weekend."
2010-11-22T06:27:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,i mean if this doesn't work
2010-11-22T06:28:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,If it doesn't work don't use wubi. Save yourself grief and do a normal install.
2010-11-22T06:29:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"yeah but then i have to download the iso, burn it, install it, and then go through all the same trouble and headache, updates, and all that."
2010-11-22T06:29:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"i wish i could take my laptop, and just clone it onto a partition, but the lappy is a powerpc linix......an altogether different demon to face! LOL"
2010-11-22T06:30:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,about 2 minutes on the install left
2010-11-22T06:32:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"Like I said before, you're lucky that another bug in wubi didn't cause you to lose the ability to boot windows as well : https://bugs.launchpad.net/wubi/+bug/610898"
2010-11-22T06:33:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"well, if all craps out, i can spend a day installing my os's again, but first can use helix 3 to mount my ext hd, and backup all crucial data, then i can do a true dual boot........lets not curse me just yet though :)"
2010-11-22T06:33:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"I don't like bashing projects but I've found additional bugs while looking at the source for wubi to try to help you. Avoid it if you can, for now at least."
2010-11-22T06:35:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"i agree with you. i mean, my lappy dual boots mac and ubuntu, and i love it.....far less problems with it, just harder to find powerpc ports of good programs. but this wubi has given nothng but headaches.....i just don't want to lose my efforts and work on what i have done!"
2010-11-22T06:36:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,very close to done with the install
2010-11-22T06:37:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"when it completes, do i let it boot up after the restart and do the initial config, or do i pop in the live cd and just go straight to that?"
2010-11-22T06:37:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"Initial config probably isn't needed, but do it just to be safe."
2010-11-22T06:45:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"it said completing ubuntu installation, now i got the logo on the screen and its changing colors, so that looks like a sign of activity.....its just doing that though"
2010-11-22T06:46:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"i heard  quick write to the hard drive, now don't hear anything....still the logo, does wubi take this long ?"
2010-11-22T06:48:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,I don't know.
2010-11-22T06:49:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,there is NO activity at all on the HD
2010-11-22T06:49:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Never hard reboot a wubi install (if you can help it).
2010-11-22T06:52:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,that did nothing! so im going for the hard reboot!
2010-11-22T06:54:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,You just can't be content with only one problem can you? ;)
2010-11-22T06:55:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"i did the hard reboot, and it came back to the grub, and i went in and selected the it and NOW this time it got past the logo!"
2010-11-22T06:55:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,OK got some errors!
2010-11-22T06:57:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"well, should i go to the live cd now? and try it? its saying ntfs pread failed and stdin error"
2010-11-22T06:57:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,also it says cannot mount /dev/sda1 on /tmpmountpoint
2010-11-22T06:58:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"You have to boot into windows, where it will notice that the filesystem wasn't unmounted cleanly and will run chkdsk."
2010-11-22T06:59:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"something about softraid/fakeraid, run chksdk /f on windows and reboot twice....."
2010-11-22T06:59:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,so there is still hope?
2010-11-22T07:00:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Yes. Follow the directions.
2010-11-22T07:01:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"LOL well, now they are off the screen! i am in windows...can u help?"
2010-11-22T07:01:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,that was all 'latin' to me
2010-11-22T07:05:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"rebooting to windows first time now, will let you know what happens after 2 times....should i copy over the root.disk file into the ubuntu directory on second boot up?"
2010-11-22T07:07:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,No.
2010-11-22T07:07:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"ok, booting up second time, chkdsk ran fine"
2010-11-22T07:08:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,I'm going to be away for an hour or more. We can either continue after that or another day.
2010-11-22T07:08:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,like right this second you are going?
2010-11-22T07:08:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"or can you leave me with the instructions in an email. i mean, do i boot to ubuntu now?"
2010-11-22T07:09:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,or at least tell me what to do to move that /boot/ over from one to the other???
2010-11-22T07:09:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,I'll email you.
2010-11-22T07:10:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,OK 1980j.andres@gmail.com
2010-11-22T07:10:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"so, for now, do i boot to linux, or live cd or what??? after the 2nd reboot to windows and the chkdsk???"
2010-11-22T07:14:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,well this is really weird. now i got 2 logos on the screen but its like it is still getting stuck in the same place. screw it.
2010-11-22T07:14:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"EMAIL ME IF YOU CAN, I HAVE AN UBUNTU DESKTOP NOW!!!"
2010-11-22T07:16:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"ITS finishing the installation, so if you give me instructions i will attempt this alone tomorrow, if you are available to help tomorrow anytime after 230 pacific time, email me what time works for you ,and ill meet you here"
2010-11-22T07:33:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"IF you get this message, i will be ready whenever you are, my wubi installed perfectly this time! just need to copy over the /boot/ like you suggested, i wont touch ANYTHING til i hear from you LOL, playing it safe!"
2010-11-22T20:37:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,Are you here today?
2010-11-27T13:30:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Could you remind me what exactly we were working on? :)
2010-11-27T13:32:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Are you booted into the working wubi system now?
2010-11-27T13:41:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Let's see if we can fix this in the next 20 minutes. If not then noon PST tomorrow would be a good time to continue.
2010-11-27T13:42:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Either a LiveCD or the wubi install will work. If you boot into wubi there's one less thing to mount so it's slightly easier :)
2010-11-27T13:50:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Can you pastebin the output of 'mount' and the contents of /boot/grub/grub.cfg ?
2010-11-27T13:51:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"It's not a directory, it's a single file."
2010-11-27T13:56:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,sudo mount -o loop /host/ubuntu/disks/root.disk.bak /mnt/
2010-11-27T13:59:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,sudo mv /mnt/boot/ /mnt/boot-bak2; sudo cp -r /boot/ /mnt/
2010-11-27T14:02:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,sudo umount /mnt/; sudo mv /host/ubuntu/disks/root.disk /host/ubuntu/disks/root.disk.new; sudo mv /host/ubuntu/disks/root.disk.bak /host/ubuntu/disks/root.disk
2010-11-27T14:05:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"Try rebooting into wubi again. If you're really lucky you'll boot into the old wubi install. I expect there to be further problems to deal with, but I do think there's a good chance it will at least boot now,"
2010-11-27T14:12:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Yes.
2010-11-27T14:13:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,You're welcome.
2010-11-22T00:48:00.000Z,magicjoe,,ANYONE: know anything abut Wubi?
2010-11-22T00:48:00.000Z,magicjoe,,sorry
2010-11-22T00:50:00.000Z,magicjoe,,"ok, sorry, let me clarify. I have a wubi installation on an xp maching. everything was working fine, until, i just now did an update. it froze up in the middle of that. so i had to manually restart the computer. when i try to boot up now, i only have windows in grub"
2010-11-22T00:50:00.000Z,magicjoe,,any way to get that back?
2010-11-22T00:52:00.000Z,magicjoe,,"basically i have a folder in xp called ubuntu, and it has large files that are my ubuntu installation, but there is a folder called boot, which has a folder called grub, which is now empty. can i rebuild a 'grub' file in windows through notepad, that will bring this partition back alive?"
2010-11-22T00:53:00.000Z,magicjoe,,"or basically , i screwed the pooch?"
2010-11-22T00:54:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,You should be able to just add this to your boot.ini (add a new line to the end of the file):        c:\wubildr.mbr='Ubuntu'
2010-11-22T01:01:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,You should be able to just add this to your boot.ini (add a new line to the end of the file):        c:\wubildr.mbr='Ubuntu'
2010-11-22T01:02:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"so if that ini file is gone, can i create that in notepad, and add that line in? or do i need more data than that line?"
2010-11-22T01:07:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"To edit the boot.ini, 1: Right-click My Computer, and then click Properties. 2: On the Advanced tab, click Settings under Startup and Recovery."
2010-11-22T01:07:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"3: Under System Startup, click Edit.  (from http://support.microsoft.com/kb/289022 )"
2010-11-22T01:08:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,that line is in that file from the instructions you just gave me.
2010-11-22T01:09:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,I have a Wubi installation. so thats what the difference is
2010-11-22T01:10:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"I created a blank file, with that line in it, and put it into the boot/grub folder in the dir created by the wubi installer. hoping that will solve on reboot"
2010-11-22T01:10:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"called it boot.ini, and added the line you told me to put in."
2010-11-22T01:10:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"boot.ini is a windows configuration file, it's not contained in boot/grub or any wubi specific directory. It's in the root of the partition (but it's hidden and read only by default, so follow the instructions I gave to open it)."
2010-11-22T01:11:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,i did that and the line was already there.
2010-11-22T01:12:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,I guess what i need then is what do i need to put into the boot/grub folder under the wubi directory to get the ubuntu option back when i boot up?
2010-11-22T01:13:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"thats why im backing up the .disk files with all my settings and whatnot, then will reinstall wubi and replace the default .disk files with my old ones."
2010-11-22T01:13:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Odd. Can you take a picture of the menu(s) you see at boot?
2010-11-22T01:13:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"sigh. no. it happened because i was updating, and it froze"
2010-11-22T01:14:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,No to what? You can't take a picture of the menus you see at boot?
2010-11-22T01:14:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,i get the windows xp or Ubuntu
2010-11-22T01:15:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"when i click ubuntu, there is no linux option in the grub loader"
2010-11-22T01:15:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Ok. Can you boot an Ubuntu LiveCD?
2010-11-22T01:15:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"the updates removed a lot of the files, and was going to install new files, but froze up. i had to hard restart"
2010-11-22T01:16:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,I have Helix 3
2010-11-22T01:16:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"That's a problem within the root.dsk file, so re-installing won't help."
2010-11-22T01:16:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,so is there a fix for this?
2010-11-22T01:17:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"Yes, but it's hard to fix from within windows."
2010-11-22T01:17:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"well, i have helix 3. its forensics tools built on ubuntu....will that work?"
2010-11-22T01:17:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Yes.
2010-11-22T01:18:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"ok, so im going to boot up to that, and then you can help me fix my wubi?"
2010-11-22T01:18:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Yes.
2010-11-22T01:19:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,thank you for this. booting up now
2010-11-22T01:20:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,You're welcome.
2010-11-22T01:20:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,can i go smoke a cig real quick while this reboots?
2010-11-22T01:20:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"im talking to you on my laptop, my desktop has the problem"
2010-11-22T01:21:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,I'm not going to stop you (and I will still be here when you get back :)
2010-11-22T01:21:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,thanks again. brb. helix is loading
2010-11-22T01:24:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"back. thanks again for your patience and time, and help. helix is up and running"
2010-11-22T01:25:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Do you know how to mount partitions and how to loop mount files?
2010-11-22T01:26:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"sort of. i am a noob, but have taken linux classes in college. i catch on quick. i have a terminal open, and have su to root"
2010-11-22T01:27:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,my windows partition is mounted
2010-11-22T01:27:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Can you pastebin the output of 'blkid'?
2010-11-22T01:27:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"i cant past it to here because this is my laptop, and the wubi is on my destop, but i can type in what it says...let me run that"
2010-11-22T01:28:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,If you've already mounted your windows partition (and you know the mount point) then I don't need that output.
2010-11-22T01:29:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,yeah its dev/hda1
2010-11-22T01:31:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,are you there?
2010-11-22T01:31:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Yes.
2010-11-22T01:31:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,ok just checking. what do i do now? lol
2010-11-22T01:32:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,To mount your wubi root.disk run 'mount -o loop /mountpoint/ubuntu/disks/root.disk /mnt/'.
2010-11-22T01:33:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,do that verbatim or substitube mountpoint with the actual mountpoint?
2010-11-22T01:33:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Substitute mountpoint.
2010-11-22T01:35:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"/dev/hdb5 is not a mountpoint, it's a device node."
2010-11-22T01:36:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Run 'mount' to find where /dev/hdb5 is mounted.
2010-11-22T01:36:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,media/hdb5?
2010-11-22T01:37:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,that is doing something
2010-11-22T01:38:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"command accepted with no error message, hard drive is spinning.....cursor in terminal is just blinking on a blank line now"
2010-11-22T01:39:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"hd stopped spinning, cursor still blinking on blank line.....nothing happening"
2010-11-22T01:41:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"i don't know what to do next? nothing happened on that command, the cursor went to another line, and blinks....nothing going on."
2010-11-22T01:42:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Does pressing ctrl+D do anything?
2010-11-22T01:42:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,hd starts spinning again
2010-11-22T01:44:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,and nothing.....
2010-11-22T01:44:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"No idea. The output of 'dmesg' (in another terminal) would be usefull, but it's too much to type out manually. Can you connect to the internet or transfer the output via flash drive to a computer that can?"
2010-11-22T01:46:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,many many lines of 'failed to read'
2010-11-22T01:47:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,it connects to the internet
2010-11-22T01:48:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,im confused? pastebin?
2010-11-22T01:48:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"oh the first command finally finished, and its says unknown filesystem type ext4"
2010-11-22T01:49:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,You're liveCD is too old then.
2010-11-22T01:51:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,How old are they?
2010-11-22T01:51:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"sleuth is old, but the live cd i created from an existing installation is pretty new, its karmic not lucid"
2010-11-22T01:52:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Karmic should have ext4 support.
2010-11-22T01:54:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,booting up the live cd created from existing karmic installation

2010-11-22T02:01:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"desktop is loading......slowly. but i see the background, status bars are coming soon, i hope"

2010-11-22T02:03:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"ok, my desktop should be up by then. status bars are showing up, icons not loaded yet."
2010-11-22T02:03:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,i really appreciate your help.

2010-11-22T02:23:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"are you back yet? please, i need help"
2010-11-22T02:25:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"i have my live cd running, only at command prompt. mount command does not list my dev/hda5 partition anywhere"
2010-11-22T02:37:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Sorry it took longer than I expected. I'm back now.
2010-11-22T02:38:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"i have the live cd up in command prompt, as root. the 'mount' command does not list the partition with wubi"
2010-11-22T02:40:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Run 'mkdir /media/windows' then 'mount /dev/sdXY /media/windows' (replacing 'XY' with the proper values from blkid).
2010-11-22T02:41:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,DONE
2010-11-22T02:42:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,now mount that?
2010-11-22T02:43:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Now run 'mkdir /media/wubi/' then  'mount -o loop /media/windows/ubuntu/disks/root.disk /media/wubi/'.
2010-11-22T02:44:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,done
2010-11-22T02:45:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Now run 'mount --bind /proc/ /media/wubi/proc; mount --bind /dev/ /media/wubi/dev/; mount --bind /sys/ /media/wubi/sys/'.
2010-11-22T02:47:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"error messages.....mount point media/wubi/proc does not exsist, same for /dev and /sys....with the same beginning"
2010-11-22T02:48:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,need to create those mount points first?
2010-11-22T02:48:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,how do i do that?
2010-11-22T02:49:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Those directories should already exist.
2010-11-22T02:49:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"they exist, but the mount points don't exist on this live cd, its from another system"
2010-11-22T02:50:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,/dev /proc and /sys don't exist in the LiveCD environment?
2010-11-22T02:50:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"just need the command to add mount points for those directories, then the binds should work"
2010-11-22T02:51:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,i mean '/media/wubi/proc' '/media/wibi/dev' and '/media/wubi/sys' do not exist on the live cd
2010-11-22T02:52:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Then something is wrong.
2010-11-22T02:53:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,What is the ouput of 'mount'?
2010-11-22T02:53:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"LOL thats what i mean....i was updating, and it froze, the updates removed a lot of stuff, and then didnt get to install the replacements"
2010-11-22T02:54:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,I find it hard to believe that an update would remove any of those directories.
2010-11-22T02:55:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,i have a bunch of lines that say none on /sys/kernel.... and then the last 2 lines say /dev/sdb5 on /media/windows type vfat (rw)
2010-11-22T02:55:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,and dev/loop1 on /mnt type ext4 (rw)
2010-11-22T02:56:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,can u just tell me the command to create these mnt points? and i will try to run the bind command again...? just humor me
2010-11-22T02:56:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,No.
2010-11-22T02:57:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,no?
2010-11-22T02:57:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"You mounted to /mnt/, I said to mount to /media/wubi. That's what's causing the problem."
2010-11-22T02:57:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,ok so what do i do?
2010-11-22T02:58:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,sorry. please help me get this right. i thought i typed in exactly what you told me to
2010-11-22T02:59:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,i did mkdir /media/wubi
2010-11-22T03:00:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Run 'mount --bind /proc/ /mnt/proc; mount --bind /dev/ /mnt/dev/; mount --bind /sys/ /mnt/sys/'.
2010-11-22T03:01:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,mount point /mnt/dev does not exsist
2010-11-22T03:01:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,mkdir /mnt/dev?
2010-11-22T03:03:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,No.
2010-11-22T03:04:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,ok....
2010-11-22T03:04:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Let's try mounting the root.disk again. Run 'sudo umount /mnt/' then 'mount -o loop /media/windows/ubuntu/disks/root.disk /media/wubi/'.
2010-11-22T03:05:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,DONE
2010-11-22T03:06:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,now the bind command again?
2010-11-22T03:06:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"Ok, now please run 'mount' and pastebin the full output. It would help if you could connect this machine to the internet and pastebin directly from there."
2010-11-22T03:06:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,i am unfamiliar with pastebin
2010-11-22T03:07:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,i ran the command....what exactly are we looking for?
2010-11-22T03:08:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,i don't follow? so i run the pastebin command? and what URL?
2010-11-22T03:10:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,command not found pastebin
2010-11-22T03:10:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"i can see the whole output of that command, i just cant upload it. what do you need to know?"
2010-11-22T03:12:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,ok just did aptget on pastebinit
2010-11-22T03:12:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,so now you want mount | pastebinit?
2010-11-22T03:13:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,ok url is http://pastebin.com/Zx6Z24Jc
2010-11-22T03:13:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,like that?
2010-11-22T03:17:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,what happened to you? i finally understood the pastebinit and gave u my url!
2010-11-22T03:21:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,^^
2010-11-22T03:21:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,THANK GOD youre back
2010-11-22T03:21:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,url is /Zx6Z24Jc
2010-11-22T03:21:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Could you give the full URL?
2010-11-22T03:23:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,this stress makes me need to smoke another cigarette....will you be here still? i will be quick. im trying everything you tell me
2010-11-22T03:23:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,i figured out the pastebinit
2010-11-22T03:24:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Yes.
2010-11-22T03:24:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,I will seriously send you money if you can get my wubi back!
2010-11-22T03:26:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,i am back
2010-11-22T03:27:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,did i do the pastebin correctly? and does that help?
2010-11-22T03:27:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Yes and yes.
2010-11-22T03:28:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Run 'umount /mnt/' then 'mount -o loop /media/windows/ubuntu/disks/root.disk /media/wubi/' then run 'mount | pastebinit' and give the URL.
2010-11-22T03:28:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,sweet. sorry to be a nuisance. you really are a great soul for doing this. THANK you again. i really will send you money if you get this going for me.
2010-11-22T03:29:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,the umount says device is busy!
2010-11-22T03:30:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Try running 'cd' first.
2010-11-22T03:31:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,can i force this to quit?
2010-11-22T03:31:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,still says buys
2010-11-22T03:32:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Try 'fuser -k /mnt/'
2010-11-22T03:33:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"that was successful, don't know what it did"
2010-11-22T03:33:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,It killed any processes with open files in /mnt/. Now try 'umount /mnt/' again (if you haven't already).
2010-11-22T03:34:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,still buys
2010-11-22T03:34:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,still busy i mean
2010-11-22T03:35:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Run 'umount /mnt/dev/; umount /mnt/proc/; umount /mnt/sys/; umount /mnt/'
2010-11-22T03:36:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,mnt/dev not mounted /mnt still busy
2010-11-22T03:37:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Did you forget the leading '/' in 'umount /mnt/dev/'?
2010-11-22T03:37:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,nope i put in all the slashes you put in
2010-11-22T03:38:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Try running 'sudo umount -a'.
2010-11-22T03:39:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,ok mnt is no longer mounted!
2010-11-22T03:40:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,now the loop command?
2010-11-22T03:40:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"Ok. Now run 'mount /dev/sdXY /media/windows/' (again, replacing XY with the proper values)."
2010-11-22T03:41:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,done
2010-11-22T03:42:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Now run 'mount -o loop /media/windows/ubuntu/disks/root.disk /media/wubi/'
2010-11-22T03:42:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,DONE
2010-11-22T03:43:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"Now run 'mkdir /media/wubi/media/windows/' (I know that seems odd, but I mean exactly what I typed)."
2010-11-22T03:44:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U, DONE
2010-11-22T03:45:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Now run 'mount --bind /media/windows/ /media/wubi/media/windows/'. Then run 'mount | pastebinit' and give the URL.

2010-11-22T03:47:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"Not that it should be a problem, but did you really install XP to a fat32 partition rather than ntfs?"
2010-11-22T03:48:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,no its ntfs that is just a data partition that was shared on linux and xp
2010-11-22T03:49:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"the NEWSHARE partition is where wubi is at, but it worked fine"
2010-11-22T03:50:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"i mean, the windows is installed on an ntfs partition, but the newshare partition is fat, used for data files that are shared on both OSs"
2010-11-22T03:50:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,and that wubi is installed on the newshare partition
2010-11-22T03:50:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,hope that makes sense
2010-11-22T03:51:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"Ahh, installing wubi to a separate partition from 'C:' is probably the root cause of the problem. Wubi is currently embarassingly bad at dealing with being installed to a different partition than 'C:'. You are lucky you're still able to boot windows in fact."
2010-11-22T03:52:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"it was working fine forever, with no problems. it only started today when i ran updates, and it froze up"
2010-11-22T03:53:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"We'll continue with what I was planning to do, but there may be additional problems I wasn't expecting because it's a separate partition."

2010-11-22T03:57:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,is there a slash after the second proc?
2010-11-22T03:57:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"It works with or without the '/'. But yes, I meant to have one."
2010-11-22T03:57:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,successful
2010-11-22T03:58:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Now run 'chroot /media/wubi/'.

2010-11-22T03:59:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,You need a 64 bit liveCD :(
2010-11-22T04:00:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,NOOOOO
2010-11-22T04:00:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,there is no way to do this fix on a 32 bit system?
2010-11-22T04:00:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,You can fix it. You'll just have to edit the grub.cfg manually instead of using update-grub.
2010-11-22T04:01:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"can you PLEASE help me do that?  when i booted to windows, i saw the /ubuntu/boot/grub directory, but there was nothing in that. how do i get the grub back???"
2010-11-22T04:04:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,how can i update the .cfg file?
2010-11-22T04:04:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"Just wait, it takes a while to write an explanation :)"
2010-11-22T04:04:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,ok sorry.
2010-11-22T04:05:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,First run 'chmod +w /media/wubi/boot/grub/grub.cfg'.

2010-11-22T04:10:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,No. Just annoying and tedious :)
2010-11-22T04:11:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"i truly will pay you for helping me. im on a college student budget, but i can make installments. i mean, like 100 bucks? in installments, or like 50 or so?"

2010-11-22T04:18:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,and my settings will still be there? hopefully?
2010-11-22T04:18:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Yes.
2010-11-22T04:19:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"ok, worth a shot. so how do i obtain this image, and what do i do with it? lol, im sure you are typing instructions right now, so i will wait"

2010-11-22T04:27:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,Please tell me you are there?
2010-11-22T04:28:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,I am. It's just taking a while to make the modifications needed for things to work on your setup.
2010-11-22T04:28:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,ok awesome.
2010-11-22T04:32:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Ok. Run 'sudo mv /media/wubi/boot/ /media/wubi/boot-broken/'.

2010-11-22T04:39:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"the live cd i am running was 64 bit, from comp at school...my desktop with wubi, i don't think is 64 bit...."
2010-11-22T04:39:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"were you looking at the stuff from the live cd instance of linux, or the wubi, and windows specs?"
2010-11-22T04:40:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,You shouldn't have had a problem chrooting into a 32 bit system from a 64 bit liveCD.

2010-11-22T04:40:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,What is the output of 'uname -m'?
2010-11-22T04:40:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"15%, slowly but surely"
2010-11-22T04:41:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"cant do that yet, waiting for the dl of your file"
2010-11-22T04:44:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,30% and ticking.....
2010-11-22T04:48:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,38%......dang! i will run teh uname -m when its done
2010-11-22T04:48:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,taking another smoke break while this downloads.
2010-11-22T04:54:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,60%.....for 15MB this is taking a while!
2010-11-22T04:55:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,I'm using 3G wireless for internet access because my main connection died due to snow. That's why it's so slow.
2010-11-22T04:56:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"its ok, i can live....there is activity so thats a good sign! :)"
2010-11-22T05:06:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,96% less than a minute!!!
2010-11-22T05:08:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,OK and we are good!!! Now what?
2010-11-22T05:10:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Run 'tar -C /media/wubi/ -xf /media/wubi/boot_dir.tar.gz'.
2010-11-22T05:10:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,After running that you should now have a /media/wubi/boot/ with kernel images in it.
2010-11-22T05:11:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,And could you now tell me the output of 'uname -m'?
2010-11-22T05:11:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,i686
2010-11-22T05:12:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,and how do i verify the kernel is there?
2010-11-22T05:12:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"That's 32 bit, 64 bit would be 'x86_64'."
2010-11-22T05:12:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,yeah but didn't you just give me a 64 bit one?
2010-11-22T05:13:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"The liveCD you're using is 32 bit, your wubi installation is 64 bit."
2010-11-22T05:13:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,OK. so what should i do now? just reboot it?
2010-11-22T05:13:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Yes.
2010-11-22T05:15:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,whats the command to make it spit out my cd and restart?
2010-11-22T05:15:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,'reboot'
2010-11-22T05:19:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,well the kernel was there in the grub list! looks good so far!
2010-11-22T05:19:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,wait! ok mount mount point /dev/shm does not exist
2010-11-22T05:20:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,control D will terminate this shell give root password for maintenance
2010-11-22T05:21:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"and a bunch of failed mountall commands, and and inti status 4, fsck from util-linux-ng 2.16 mount of root file system failed"
2010-11-22T05:22:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"at the end is says in parentheses or type control d to continue: dev/loop0: clean, 11746/256000 files, 194557/1024000 blocks"
2010-11-22T05:22:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Try pressing ctrl+D.
2010-11-22T05:23:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,it restarted the box
2010-11-22T05:23:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,should i try recovery mode?
2010-11-22T05:24:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Yes. It probably won't boot either but it can't hurt to try.
2010-11-22T05:24:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"so, im screwed? :("
2010-11-22T05:26:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"WAIT! if i can get to the /etc and back all of that up to my ext hd, can i just run wubi again, and then overwrite with my backed up etc to the /etc? wont that save my settings for everything???"
2010-11-22T05:26:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,recovery did the same thing by the way
2010-11-22T05:27:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"I think the problem is that the initrd images I gave you are made to boot from an ntfs partition, and don't have fat32 support."
2010-11-22T05:28:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"well, in the grub, i see a VISTA loader option..... that tells me, maybe you got the specs from the pc that the live cd was made on....not the specs of my pc that has the wubi."
2010-11-22T05:28:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"because i don't have vista on this pc at all, never have. but the school pc i made the live cd on was running vista"
2010-11-22T05:28:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,The windows entry won't work on your machine.
2010-11-22T05:29:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"No, that's from the test VM I grabbed the /boot/ directory from."
2010-11-22T05:29:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"well i know that won't but this kernel isn't either....so im just asking/guessing that this whatever that is listed in grub that says linux, is meant for the OTHER pc"
2010-11-22T05:30:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,ok.... so is this give up and start over time? or is there anything we can do from the command line (i can get to it from here without live cd) and fix it?
2010-11-22T05:31:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"It is, and that's the problem. I'm trying to see if I can rebuild the initrd with vfat support now. If that fails, you should be still be able to backup your current root.disk, re-install wubi, then copy /boot/ from the new root.disk to the old one, and restore the old root.disk."
2010-11-22T05:31:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,was my /etc idea any good or worth trying?
2010-11-22T05:33:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"ok, but i don't follow.....the file is just an image the root.disk, so how can i copy the boot thingy? oh live cd again? and whatnot?"
2010-11-22T05:33:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,why didnt we just try that from the start? lol
2010-11-22T05:34:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,I didn't realize the extent of the problem at the start :)
2010-11-22T05:35:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"if you are up for it, i propose we go that route from here on out. shouldn't be hard to mount the ex hd, and the root.disk file, then copy what i need, then i can just do the wubi, on my own, and basically reverse the steps you teach me ?"
2010-11-22T05:36:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"then you can email me a way to pay you. but i can get the bulk of it done now, and reach a stopping point for the day, but still have a possible solution"
2010-11-22T05:38:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,I'm curious if my updated initrd will work. If you don't mind trying one last thing before going the other route.
2010-11-22T05:39:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,ok....i booted to the live cd...is that what i need to do?
2010-11-22T05:41:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,im at command prompt in the live cd again
2010-11-22T05:41:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Yes. Run 'mkdir /media/windows; mkdir /media/wubi/; mount /dev/sdb5 /media/windows/; mount -o loop /media/windows/ubuntu/disks/root.disk /media/wubi/'.
2010-11-22T05:48:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,OK did that!
2010-11-22T05:48:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Now run 'cd /media/wubi/boot/ && mv initrd.img-2.6.35-22-generic initrd.img-2.6.35-22-generic-bad && wget http://jordanu.dyndns.org/initrd.img-2.6.35-22-generic'
2010-11-22T05:52:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"OK must have done that right, its downloading"
2010-11-22T05:54:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"That's odd, because according to my network statistics and apache logs you don't appear to be downloading anything from me."
2010-11-22T05:55:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,it says jordanu.dyndns.org and an ipaddress on port 80! 28k/s!!!
2010-11-22T05:55:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,NOW 48k/s!!!
2010-11-22T05:56:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,60% but slowed to 5k/s
2010-11-22T05:58:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,I wasn't seeing the upload because my network applet is apparently just not working at the moment. I see it now.
2010-11-22T05:58:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,much faster speed!
2010-11-22T06:00:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,OK done!!!
2010-11-22T06:00:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Try rebooting. If it fails this time then just backup your root.disk and start re-installing.
2010-11-22T06:01:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U," if this fails, i need ur help to backup that thing ur talking about"
2010-11-22T06:02:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"kernel panic, not syncing vfs unable to mount root fs on unknown block 0,0"
2010-11-22T06:04:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"Ok, back to the drawing board! so, can u just help me mount my ext hd, backup what i need to, then just tell me how to replace it later"
2010-11-22T06:04:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Ok. To backup the root.disk simply copy it (or move it) from C:\ubuntu\disks\root.disk to anywhere outside of the Ubuntu directory (your desktop will work).
2010-11-22T06:05:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,so i don't need to go back to the live cd? and mount the ext hd?
2010-11-22T06:06:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"No, you can do it from within windows."
2010-11-22T06:06:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,i need to be able to mount the image to extract the boot part of the root.disk file though right?
2010-11-22T06:07:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Yes.
2010-11-22T06:07:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"ok, so you are saying do this all from windows? i just want to know what im doing lol"
2010-11-22T06:07:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Backup the root.disk and re-install wubi within windows. Then we can copy the /boot directory over between the images from the LiveCD.
2010-11-22T06:07:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"while i have the live cd at root command prompt, is there anything we need to do NOW?"
2010-11-22T06:08:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"ok gotcha, rebooting"
2010-11-22T06:18:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"OK, so root.disk is on my desktop, but the uninstaller does nothing when i double click it!"
2010-11-22T06:18:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,trying through control panel now
2010-11-22T06:20:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"NOPE even in control panel, if i try to uninstall wubi, it says do not have access to F:\ubuntu\uninstall-wubi.exe"
2010-11-22T06:21:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,do i just delete the files? or just run the installer again?
2010-11-22T06:24:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"Answered that myself lol....just deleted the directory, and now running installer.....root.disk is on desktop......all good?"
2010-11-22T06:24:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,It may not think wubi is installed since there's no root.disk. Try creating a file named root.disk in ubuntu\disks\.
2010-11-22T06:25:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,I don't know what will happen if you re-install without uninstalling first.
2010-11-22T06:25:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"the file was still there, i only copied it to desktop.....it was somethin else totally.....im risking it!"
2010-11-22T06:26:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"at this point its the last hope. if this doesnt work, i will thank you for your time and call it a day. i have a paper to write, due tomorrow, and my girlfriend has been wanting me to come over since 230"
2010-11-22T06:27:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"if this works, i will just have to reinstall the whole thing from scratch. and get my compiz and all that setup, and my cairo-dock, its terrible. that will be an all day thing, next weekend."
2010-11-22T06:27:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,i mean if this doesn't work
2010-11-22T06:28:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,If it doesn't work don't use wubi. Save yourself grief and do a normal install.
2010-11-22T06:29:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"yeah but then i have to download the iso, burn it, install it, and then go through all the same trouble and headache, updates, and all that."
2010-11-22T06:29:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"i wish i could take my laptop, and just clone it onto a partition, but the lappy is a powerpc linix......an altogether different demon to face! LOL"
2010-11-22T06:30:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,about 2 minutes on the install left
2010-11-22T06:32:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"Like I said before, you're lucky that another bug in wubi didn't cause you to lose the ability to boot windows as well : https://bugs.launchpad.net/wubi/+bug/610898"
2010-11-22T06:33:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"well, if all craps out, i can spend a day installing my os's again, but first can use helix 3 to mount my ext hd, and backup all crucial data, then i can do a true dual boot........lets not curse me just yet though :)"
2010-11-22T06:33:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"I don't like bashing projects but I've found additional bugs while looking at the source for wubi to try to help you. Avoid it if you can, for now at least."
2010-11-22T06:35:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"i agree with you. i mean, my lappy dual boots mac and ubuntu, and i love it.....far less problems with it, just harder to find powerpc ports of good programs. but this wubi has given nothng but headaches.....i just don't want to lose my efforts and work on what i have done!"
2010-11-22T06:36:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,very close to done with the install
2010-11-22T06:37:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"when it completes, do i let it boot up after the restart and do the initial config, or do i pop in the live cd and just go straight to that?"
2010-11-22T06:37:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"Initial config probably isn't needed, but do it just to be safe."
2010-11-22T06:45:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"it said completing ubuntu installation, now i got the logo on the screen and its changing colors, so that looks like a sign of activity.....its just doing that though"
2010-11-22T06:46:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"i heard  quick write to the hard drive, now don't hear anything....still the logo, does wubi take this long ?"
2010-11-22T06:48:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,I don't know.
2010-11-22T06:49:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,there is NO activity at all on the HD
2010-11-22T06:49:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Never hard reboot a wubi install (if you can help it).
2010-11-22T06:52:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,that did nothing! so im going for the hard reboot!
2010-11-22T06:54:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,You just can't be content with only one problem can you? ;)
2010-11-22T06:55:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"i did the hard reboot, and it came back to the grub, and i went in and selected the it and NOW this time it got past the logo!"
2010-11-22T06:55:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,OK got some errors!
2010-11-22T06:57:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"well, should i go to the live cd now? and try it? its saying ntfs pread failed and stdin error"
2010-11-22T06:57:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,also it says cannot mount /dev/sda1 on /tmpmountpoint
2010-11-22T06:58:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"You have to boot into windows, where it will notice that the filesystem wasn't unmounted cleanly and will run chkdsk."
2010-11-22T06:59:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"something about softraid/fakeraid, run chksdk /f on windows and reboot twice....."
2010-11-22T06:59:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,so there is still hope?
2010-11-22T07:00:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Yes. Follow the directions.
2010-11-22T07:01:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"LOL well, now they are off the screen! i am in windows...can u help?"
2010-11-22T07:01:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,that was all 'latin' to me
2010-11-22T07:05:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"rebooting to windows first time now, will let you know what happens after 2 times....should i copy over the root.disk file into the ubuntu directory on second boot up?"
2010-11-22T07:07:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,No.
2010-11-22T07:07:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"ok, booting up second time, chkdsk ran fine"
2010-11-22T07:08:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,I'm going to be away for an hour or more. We can either continue after that or another day.
2010-11-22T07:08:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,like right this second you are going?
2010-11-22T07:08:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"or can you leave me with the instructions in an email. i mean, do i boot to ubuntu now?"
2010-11-22T07:09:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,or at least tell me what to do to move that /boot/ over from one to the other???
2010-11-22T07:09:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,I'll email you.
2010-11-22T07:10:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,OK 1980j.andres@gmail.com
2010-11-22T07:10:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"so, for now, do i boot to linux, or live cd or what??? after the 2nd reboot to windows and the chkdsk???"
2010-11-22T07:14:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,well this is really weird. now i got 2 logos on the screen but its like it is still getting stuck in the same place. screw it.
2010-11-22T07:14:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"EMAIL ME IF YOU CAN, I HAVE AN UBUNTU DESKTOP NOW!!!"
2010-11-22T07:16:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"ITS finishing the installation, so if you give me instructions i will attempt this alone tomorrow, if you are available to help tomorrow anytime after 230 pacific time, email me what time works for you ,and ill meet you here"
2010-11-22T07:33:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,"IF you get this message, i will be ready whenever you are, my wubi installed perfectly this time! just need to copy over the /boot/ like you suggested, i wont touch ANYTHING til i hear from you LOL, playing it safe!"
2010-11-22T20:37:00.000Z,magicjoe,Jordan_U,Are you here today?
2010-11-27T13:30:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Could you remind me what exactly we were working on? :)
2010-11-27T13:32:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Are you booted into the working wubi system now?
2010-11-27T13:41:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Let's see if we can fix this in the next 20 minutes. If not then noon PST tomorrow would be a good time to continue.
2010-11-27T13:42:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Either a LiveCD or the wubi install will work. If you boot into wubi there's one less thing to mount so it's slightly easier :)
2010-11-27T13:50:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,Can you pastebin the output of 'mount' and the contents of /boot/grub/grub.cfg ?
2010-11-27T13:51:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,"It's not a directory, it's a single file."
2010-11-27T13:56:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,sudo mount -o loop /host/ubuntu/disks/root.disk.bak /mnt/
2010-11-27T13:59:00.000Z,Jordan_U,magicjoe,sudo mv /mnt/boot/ /mnt/boot-bak2; sudo cp -r /boot/ /mnt/
